Potter appointed new Sweden boss,"Graham Potter has not been out of work for long. The former West Ham boss will be the new Sweden head coach, taking charge of the men’s national team with the goal of qualifying for next summer’s World Cup. After only one point from the first four matches in the World Cup qualifiers, Jon Dahl Tomasson lost his job last week. Potter takes charge from today with the short-term agreement to extend over the ongoing qualifying period with matches against Switzerland and Slovenia in November and a potential playoff in March. The deal will be extended if Sweden make it to the World Cup. ""Together with the players, I want to realise the fans' dream of a championship summer,"" says Potter. ""I am very humbled by the assignment, but also incredibly inspired. Sweden has fantastic players who deliver in the world's best leagues during the weeks. My job will be to create the conditions so that we as a team deliver at the highest level to take Sweden to the World Cup next summer.” Potter, who was sacked by West Ham on September 27, retains a strong reputation in Sweden after seven successful years at Ostersunds FK between 2011 and 2018, during which time he took the club into Europe. ""It feels very good that Graham in,” says Kim Kallstrom, the football director of Sweden’s football federation. “We are all aware of the situation we are in, and believe that with his leadership skills he will bring the team together in a good way. He is tactically skilled at creating conditions to win matches and has an ability to identify players' strengths and how they interact in the best way.”",20/10/2025
Pope confirms clause triggered in Newcastle deal,"Newcastle goalkeeper Nick Pope has confirmed the club have triggered a one-year extension on his current contract. Sky Sports News reported the clause had been triggered earlier in October, meaning he will now remain at St James' Park until 2027. The 33-year-old goalkeeper, who has been in outstanding form so far this season, accepted the option as part of a reward for helping the club qualify for the Champions League. Speaking ahead of the Champions League clash against Benfica on Tuesday, Pope was asked about how it felt to extend his stay with the Magpies. ""My contract is up in 2027,"" he said. ""I look forward to spending as long as I can here.""",20/10/2025
Potter's pride as he returns to Sweden,"Graham Potter has spoken of his pride at returning to Sweden as national team manager, having begun his coaching career in the country. His first task is qualifying for the World Cup, having earned just just one point from their opening four qualifying games. “My feelings for being the Swedish national team manager are one of extreme pride, it’s a really exciting day for me,” Potter said. “It’s quite clear, we want to get to the World Cup, simple as that. We have to get the team together, playing well, winning games, and our aim is to get to the World Cup. “How I see the players, the team and the group is positive. The challenge now and the work is to make us into a really good team.” Potter took Ostersunds from the fourth division of Swedish football to the first division during his seven-year tenure at the club. “I think back to coming into the country in 2011, playing in the fourth tier in Swedish football, and so to be here now I'm incredibly proud and it feels really, really special,"" Potter added. “I always keep an eye on Swedish football because of my relationship with the country. “Swedish football means an incredible amount to me. It’s the start of my professional coaching career, I’ll be forever grateful for the time I had here, for the football family here – it’s an incredible place and one I'm really proud to be part of.” A poor run of results has left Sweden bottom of their qualifying group, and their most recent 1-0 defeat to Kosovo on October 13 led to the dismissal of Jon Dahl Tomasson. “I'm aware of the results that the team had and the players that we have, but now it’s about looking forward and I'm really excited to be here and help the team achieve the goal of the World Cup,” Potter said. “It’s an incredible opportunity for me, a very proud moment in my life and my career. “What I look forward to most is meeting the players, all the people in the football family in Sweden, our supporters, and then competing and winning games to get to the World Cup. “The message to our supporters is, we need their support. Swedish football fans are renowned for being incredible around the world and I'm really looking forward to experiencing that.”",20/10/2025

'I could never have asked for that amount of money!',"Former Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp speaking on the Diary of a CEO podcast: ""We built three stands and a training ground. Nobody ever told me that this is possible that we can spend like that. ""My last year at Liverpool, the Adidas deal, the new stadium, all these kind of things earned more money, but never, ever could I have asked for that amount of money, but that's not a problem. ""I love the fact we were as successful as we were and built new stands and built a training ground, because we talk now about transfer windows in the way you want to talk about it, spend a lot of money, but there's no discussion about the stands and no discussion about the training ground. They are second to none. ""The same place where Anfield is, they could build pretty much a new stadium without leaving the old one so that's a fantastic story and that will stay forever. Maybe at one point they decide the Kop could be for even more people or whatever, but you could do stuff there. And that's what I love about this. ""I really want, as much as I can - and it's not my first target because I have to win football games with my team - a club that benefits from the time we were together after we left. I want that.""",20/10/2025
Klopp: I turned down Man Utd in 2013,"Jurgen Klopp has revealed he turned down the Manchester United job in 2013 having decided the project was “not for me” after he was told things during discussions that he ""didn't like."" Speaking on the Diary of a CEO podcast, Klopp who was later appointed Liverpool manager in October 2015, explained: “Yes, I spoke to them [Manchester United]. ""In the year when Sir Alex Ferguson retired they spoke to me. Of course they were interested. “At one point. At that time I would have been interested. I was young, I had a sensational team at Dortmund, my God. They probably thought ‘what is he doing there?’ “They tried. It was the wrong time, wrong moment. I had a contract at Dortmund and wouldn’t have left, not really for nobody at that time. “There are some reasons [why he didn’t take the job]. The people in that conversation told me [things] which I didn’t like. “United was that big – “we get all the players we want. We get him, we get him, we get him, we get him” and I was sitting there … It was not my project. “It was the wrong time but on top of that it was not my project. I didn't want to bring back, I don’t know, Pogba. “Paul is a sensational player, my God, but these things don’t work usually. Or Cristiano, my God, we all know together with Messi he is the best player in the world but bringing back never helps. “At that time in 2013 it was obviously not about Cristiano maybe about Paul, I’m not even sure, [I don’t] get the numbers [dates] together, but the idea is we bring the best players together and let’s go.""",20/10/2025

Keane: Mainoo might have to move on,"Roy Keane believes Kobbie Mainoo may have to move on from Manchester United if he cannot get in Ruben Amorim's team after another snub in a big game. Mainoo was left on United's bench for the Super Sunday clash at LIverpool despite veteran midfielder Casemiro playing two games for Brazil over the international break and travelling a long distance from South Korea. Casemiro still started over Mainoo, but Keane understands why Mainoo is not playing right now. ""It's obviously seems to be a problem for Mainoo getting into this team,"" said Keane to Sky Sports. The word coming out is they don't' think he can cover the ground that quickly, but if you look at Man Utd's other midfielders they've got, they're not great at that either. ""Asa a young player, he has to suck that up and work hard And when he gets a chance, he has to take it. ""A young player with good potential cannot be guaranteed a place in United's team. But it will come down to the player himself. Your job every day every week is to make sure the manager puts you in the team. ""If the manager deep down doesn't fancy him? I don't know. We will find that out in the next few weeks. Because if he doesn't fancy him, he might have to move him on. ""But Mainoo's got that opportunity. He got some plaudits when he first came in, he was involved in the England squad. He has to get back to that, ""He's had opportunities recently and when he's come on and got opportunities, he just looks a bit short for me. I wouldn't be scratching my head thinking: why is he not in the team? I can see why he is not picking him at this moment in time.""",19/10/2025
'Liverpool need Slot to act like a Real Madrid manager',"Sky Sports Jamie Carragher at Anfield: ""They’ve brought in a lot of players and it’s given the manager a few problems. ""When you have spent that much on players, you have to make that work and you have to find a way to get the players into the team. The idea that Florian Wirtz won’t get into the Liverpool team most weeks is nonsensical. You are going to have to find a way to make it work. ""It makes me think a little bit of Real Madrid. The summer Liverpool had was Real Madrid-like, it wasn’t Liverpool like. Liverpool don’t normally – at least when I played and under Jurgen Klopp – go and buy the best players on the market for the most market. That wasn’t the way Liverpool did things, but they did it this summer. ""Alexander Isak is arguably the best available striker on the market and Florian Wirtz is the best No 10, they paid big money for them. That’s what Real Madrid would do most summers – and then the managers like Vicente del Bosque or Carlo Ancelotti would just have to figure it out. They would be given a set of players and that’s what Arne Slot has got to do. ""It’s been a Real Madrid summer for Liverpool in terms of transfer fees, they may need their manager to be a Real Madrid manager as such for the next few months and just try and make things work. Not necessarily getting them into his system, but how does he get this team functioning well and getting the best from them?""",19/10/2025

Silva in frame for Forest job?,"Fulham boss Marco Silva has major internal support at Nottingham Forest over succeeding Ange Postecoglou, according to BBC Sport. However, it is claimed that Silva has a ""significant"" release clause in his contract at Craven Cottage, which provides an obstacle for Forest. Postecoglou was sacked by Forest less than 20 minutes after the full-time whistle of Saturday's 3-0 home defeat to Chelsea. Sky Sports News understands that Sean Dyche is in advanced talks with Forest about the prospect of becoming their new head coach - but other candidates have not yet been ruled out.

Marinakis wants to move quickly in search for third coach of season,"Latest from Sky Sports News' Anton Toloui and Rob Dorsett: The decision over who replaces Ange Postecoglou lies entirely with Nottingham Forest owner Marinakis, who is looking for his third head coach of the season already. He knows this next managerial appointment is key in trying to produce some stability and belief in the dressing room and amongst the supporter base after a damaging period for the club. In that regard, Forest's hierarchy currently believe Dyche is the best man to steady the ship, organise and motivate the players, and crucially keep the club in the Premier League despite having ambitions of finishing further up the table. Another key demand from the owner is for whoever takes over to maximise the significant investment that was made in the playing squad in the summer. Forest spent more than £180m in the transfer window, and £130m of that talent wasn't in the matchday squad against Chelsea. This was another area of dispute between the owner and Postecoglu, Sky Sports News has been told. Despite the importance of the appointment, Forest's bosses are keen to move quickly, with the Europa League game against Porto to come on Thursday.",18/10/2025
Nottingham Forest in advanced Dyche talks,"Latest from Sky Sports News' Anton Toloui and Rob Dorsett: Sean Dyche is in advanced talks with Nottingham Forest about the prospect of becoming their new manager - but other candidates have not yet been ruled out. Former Man City boss Roberto Mancini has held positive talks about the vacancy and has been out of work since leaving his role as head coach of the Saudi Arabia national team in 20234. Forest bosses have also shown interest in Italian coach Luciano Spalletti, who was sounded out about the role but, according to Sky in Italy, he is no longer in contention. Ex-Olympiakos head coach Pedro Martins, the Portuguese currently working in Qatar, was considered, but will not be taking over at Forest. While Mancini is not yet out of the running, Sky Sports News has been told that Dyche is very much the front-runner, and could be appointed quickly if owner Evangelos Marinakis finally decides he is the right man to replace Ange Postecoglou. The Australian, who could not win any of his eight games in charge at Forest, was sacked within 18 minutes of the defeat to Chelsea at the City Ground on Saturday lunchtime. Sky Sports",18/10/2025

Maresca insists relationship with Chelsea hierarchy is ‘normal’,"Chelsea head coach Enzo Maresca believes the media struggle to accept that he has a “normal” relationship with his Blues bosses. Co-owner Behdad Eghbali is a frequent visitor to the home changing room at Stamford Bridge after matches, as are co-sporting directors Paul Winstanley and Laurence Stewart. At times it has prompted questioning as to the nature of the conversations that go on in the immediate aftermath of games, particularly when results have been poor. The trio were seen entering the changing room almost before Maresca and his players after a messy collapse that precipitated a 3-1 defeat to Brighton in September, with the Italian grilled over what the hierarchy had made of his team’s capitulation. He has repeatedly insisted that any talk of a strained atmosphere is wide of the mark, and ahead of Saturday’s meeting with Nottingham Forest at the City Ground said it had been business as usual with owners. “I spoke with Behdad (Thursday) night,” said Maresca. “It was just a normal conversation like almost every week. Even if you (the media) struggle to accept or to understand. “They are always in the changing room,” he said. “We always have conversations with Paul and Laurence and Behdad. Nothing has changed since I joined the club. “We all know that we are going in the right direction, we all know there are things we need to do better. We all know there are things with which we are happy.”",17/10/2025
Frank hails Paratici’s ‘great eye’ on return to Tottenham,"Tottenham head coach Thomas Frank is aware of Fabio Paratici’s recent criminal case but has praised the “good guy” with a “great eye” after the Italian officially returned to the club. Spurs announced on Wednesday that Paratici was back as co-sporting director after being used as a consultant for the past two years since his resignation in 2023. Paratici first joined Tottenham in 2021, but stepped down to deal with allegations of false accounting at former club Juventus. The Italian subsequently served a 30-month ban imposed by FIFA – which did not prevent his consultancy work – before a criminal case over the same matter reached a conclusion last month in Rome after a plea bargain by Paratici and others involved was entered. With the court case over, Paratici has been able to return to Tottenham and will work alongside Johan Lange, who has been technical director for the past 24 months but has been promoted to co-sporting director. Ahead of Sunday’s visit of Aston Villa, Frank said: “I’ve heard about (the case). I don’t know too much about the details. “I know Fabio as a good guy at the times I’ve met him and I think he’s got a lot of quality and I look forward to working with him. “The strong abilities both Johan and Fabio have, I think that they complement each other so well, so it’s like a perfect match. “Johan is very good to put in good structures and building that recruitment department, our insight department, our analysis department. “I think Fabio comes with another angle and another experience from 10 years in Italy with a great network and a great eye and a great vision for football. I think the way they complement each other is very good.”",17/10/2025
Potter on verge of becoming Sweden manager,"Graham Potter is close to agreeing a deal with the Swedish FA to take over as the national team manager. He will be tasked with trying to help Sweden qualify for next summer’s World Cup. That is a tall order as Sweden are currently bottom of World Cup qualifying Group B, with only a point from their opening four matches. The best they can hope for is to overhaul Kosovo and Slovenia to finish second, thereby making it into the play-offs. To do that, they have to win their final two games and hope Kosovo lose both of theirs. Former Blackburn manager Jon Dahl Tomason was sacked on Tuesday following the 1-0 home defeat to Kosovo. The contract being discussed with Potter is a short-term one, which will see him take charge in time for next month's international break when they face a must-win game away at group-leaders Switzerland. In the unlikely event he were to help Sweden achieve qualification, his contract would be extended to include the World Cup finals next summer, and probably beyond. Potter, who was sacked by West Ham last month, began his coaching career in Sweden with Ostersunds FK, winning three promotions in four seasons and the Swedish cup. He still has a great number of friends and contacts in the country. Whilst he didn't have a burning desire to go into international management at this stage of his career, he feels he owes the nation that gave him his start in football management, and wants to try to help if he can.",17/10/2025
Ex-Liverpool striker Borini joins Salford City until January,"Former Liverpool and Sunderland striker Fabio Borini has joined League Two side Salford City on a short-term deal until January. The 34-year-old moves to Salford as a free agent after leaving Serie B side Sampdoria in the summer. The former Chelsea and Swansea striker had been training with Salford for the last month and has officially joined the club after Jay Bird sustained a long-term injury. The ex-AC Milan and Roma forward said: “It’s been great, I came in to train to keep myself fit in this transition between contracts and Salford, the Gaffer, Alex Bruce, were kind enough to allow me to use the facilities and train here. “Experience is one thing that I can bring, but it’s not just about the experience that I have on the pitch, it’s outside of the pitch so leading by example in training, outside training, how to manage a game. I’ve never played League Two football so I need to learn as well from my team mates the main characteristics of this league, but I will bring myself as an open book for my team mates to use me, learn from me or help me, so I’m very open to this challenge. “It’s a challenge that I’m embracing and I chose to embrace because I needed the real football, something that warms my heart for football, not for anything else.” Borini will wear the number 16 shirt at ninth-placed Salford and could make his debut against Oldham on Saturday, live on Sky Sports+, with kick-off at 12.30pm.",17/10/2025

Pickford keen to build legacy at Everton after agreeing four-year deal,"Everton goalkeeper Jordan Pickford intends to “build a legacy” after signing a new four-year contract at the club. The England number one will take his stay with the Toffees to 12 years after extending his existing deal to 2029. “I’m delighted to get it done – it’s an extra two years, so four years in total,” he told evertontv. “It just shows the commitment I’ve made to Everton and also the faith the club has put into me as well. “I’m over the moon and it gives me the opportunity to build a legacy for myself here, move forward and build this club to where we want to be. “(Neville) Southall is the great at Everton and I don’t want to be too far behind him, if not in front of him, when my time comes to an end. “I think everyone’s seen the changes and how I’ve developed over time, but I’m still that lad who loves to keep the ball out of the net. “It’s been Everton who have helped me develop and a lot of hard work’s been put in as well. “It’s always felt like a natural fit for me, with the fans and the passion – it’s second to none and something I thrive off.” The 31-year-old goalkeeper, who has won all his 80 England caps while at Everton, has made 326 appearances for the Toffees.

Slow progress expected over new Glasner contract,"Latest from Sky Sports News' James Savundra: Crystal Palace have held initial talks with Oliver Glasner about extending his contract – but it is unlikely that things will progress quickly. Palace are planning for the Austrian to be in charge next season and Glasner has been involved in positive conversations about the medium-to-long-term future at the Eagles. Chairman Steve Parish confirmed those talks earlier in the international break – but the club are not putting a timescale on discussions around the 51-year-old's future and there is no deadline by which they are working towards. Glasner’s current deal expires at the end of the season and, in the background, Palace will continue to do due diligence on a number of potential managerial candidates if they do need to recruit a new head coach next summer. The Palace boss is in a brilliant position, and his stock has risen massively due to his success at Selhurst Park, helping the club claim their first ever major trophy in the FA Cup last season. The German is admired by a number of Europe's top sides and, from Glasner's perspective, there is no need or urgency to commit his future at this current stage. Behind the scenes, the club's hierarchy have been incredibly impressed by the level of professionalism shown by Glasner in spite of the uncertainty surrounding his long-term position. They are fully aware that they possess a world-class manager. There has been much outside noise surrounding the future of the likes of Glasner, Marc Guehi and Adam Wharton. However, inside the training ground there remains a real sense of calm regarding the situations around each of them.",16/10/2025

Palace relaxed over Wharton transfer 'interest',"Latest from Sky Sports News' James Savundra, Kaveh Solhehol, Lyall Thomas: Crystal Palace are relaxed about the future of Adam Wharton amid increasing speculation of interest from other clubs. Although there are currently no discussions around a new contract for the England midfielder, Palace are planning for the future with the 21-year-old a focal point of their team. Wharton signed a five-and-a-half year deal when joining from Blackburn in 2024 – meaning he still has four years remaining on his contract until 2029. Palace are not pushing for fresh terms with a release clause to ward off the big European clubs, who are naturally tracking the midfielder's progress. At the same time, Wharton is not actively seeking improved terms himself despite his impressive exploits, and any idea of a January exit is not currently on the cards. The kind of significant deals and transfer fees it would take for a player like Wharton are more typical of the summer market and many of the top clubs are currently well stocked in the defensive midfield position. Club chairman Steve Parish said last weekend: ""I think Adam at some point will want to play either in the Champions League with us - if we can make that happen - or probably with another club."" Every player has a price and Palace will not stand in Wharton’s way if his hefty valuation is met – as was the case with Eberechi Eze in the summer. The club would also make sure they have contingency plans for a replacement in place if the former Blackburn star was to depart.",15/10/2025

Sky Sports News understands discussions with former manager Steven Gerrard progressed well over the past two days, as the Gers hierarchy laid out their plans for the club. The 45-year-old is thought to be open to the idea of returning to Glasgow, four years after departing for Aston Villa. He would likely bring Gary McAllister back to the club as part of his backroom team, plus former Rangers striker Jermain Defoe, while ex-England coach Steve Holland has been sounded out too. Former Sheffield Wednesday boss Danny Rohl has also impressed Ibrox chiefs during the process and remains in the race for the job.

Man Utd make midfield signing a key target for next summer,"Latest from Sky Sports News' Rob Dorsett and Danyal Khan: Manchester United will make signing a new midfielder a key target for next summer. The club are not expected to be busy in January, having made significant investment in the team in the previous window. But the club are continuing work on the market looking ahead to next summer, which will likely be an important window for them given several players are out of contract as it stands, such as Harry Maguire and Casemiro. There is a realistic prospect that Brazilian Casemiro will not see his contract renewed, freeing up space on the wage bill and therefore presenting United with an opportunity to strengthen in that area of the field. United had looked at possible options in the middle last summer but had prioritised other positions, especially up-front. United have long been admirers of Brighton’s Carlos Baleba – but he is just one of a number of midfielders they continue to monitor. Nottingham Forest’s Elliot Anderson is another who has admirers at Old Trafford, given his impressive performances have continued into this campaign.",09/10/2025

"Henderson: With hindsight, maybe I would’ve made different Saudi decision","Jordan Henderson likened leaving Liverpool to a break-up and says in hindsight he may have taken “different decisions” than choosing to make the controversial switch to Saudi Arabia.

Henderson had been a high-profile supporter of LGBTQ+ rights and apologised for letting down or hurting anyone in the community having left Saudi to join Ajax six months into a three-year deal. The midfielder returned to the Premier League this summer by joining Brentford and admits he “struggled for a period” after ending his 12-year association with Liverpool. “It felt like a break-up,” Henderson said. “It was just difficult. “I think if you asked a lot of players when they leave a club – not just Liverpool – you have been at for so long and have that attachment to, whether you retire or move on, I think for a period of time it’s really difficult. “That was hard but within time things change, you move on, but I would say that was probably the most difficult time.”",08/10/2025

Trevoh Chalobah, Tosin Adarabioyo, Wesley Fofana, Benoit Badiashile, Josh Acheampong are all high-quality centre backs and Levi Colwill is due to return from injury later this season. Jorrel Hato and Reece James can also play at centre back and Chelsea have two centre backs out on loan who are expected to return next summer, Mamadou Sarr and Aaron Anselmino. Chelsea looked at the possibility of signing a centre back in the summer but the only high-quality option available was Dean Huijsen and he decided to join Real Madrid from Bournemouth.",07/10/2025
Chelsea's goalkeeper plans revealed,"Latest from Sky Sports News' chief correspondent Kaveh Solhekol: Chelsea have no current plans to sign a goalkeeper over the next two transfer windows. Enzo Maresca has three goalkeepers – Robert Sanchez, Filip Jorgensen and Mike Penders – who are regarded as being good enough to be their established No. 1. Sanchez is an exceptional shot-stopper and he won the award for the best goalkeeper at the Club World Cup. He has made a good start to the season and despite his red card at Manchester United, he has cut down the number of mistakes he has made. Robert Sanchez has not made a single error leading to a goal this season - compared to his five in the previous campaign Jorgensen is still also highly rated at the club and he was a transfer target for some of the biggest clubs in England in the summer. Penders has been in impressive form at Strasbourg and he has been receiving some rave reviews for his performances which have helped his side climb to third in the table. Chelsea were offered the chance to sign AC Milan goalkeeper Mike Maignan in the summer but decided not to pay the asking price because they had faith in Sanchez, Jorgensen and Penders.",07/10/2025
How much is Wharton worth?,"Former Crystal Palace boss Alan Pardew on the Transfer Show: ""Adam Wharton has done exceptionally well and there is a lot of talk of big clubs already looking at his progression. He is a player that can take the ball comfortably with real pressure on him. ""He also has outstanding vision and you can set up your team to play through him. There are not many midfielders you can do that with. ""I can understand from Crystal Palace's point of view - and particularly with Marc Guehi's situation - of [wanting] this guy tied down to a contract and possibly [with] a clause that suggests his figure might be minimum £65m-£70m."" Adam Wharton has four years left on his Crystal Palace contract",07/10/2025
Wirtz 'not a concern' for Liverpool,"Alan Pardew speaking on the Transfer Show: ""I have a bit of insight on him because Freddie Woodman is the goalkeeper at Liverpool. He said he's unbelievable in training. So I don't think there's concern there. ""What he was doing at Leverkusen was off the charts. He played in a slightly different position because he was wide off the left and would drift in, whereas now at Liverpool he's playing central. ""I think he's finding that an issue. There's a lack of time, he isn't getting time on the ball. But Freddie tells me he's as good a player he's ever seen. ""I would play him on the left for a little while and see how he evolves in the team. ""I think he is a fantastic player who will settle.""",07/10/2025
Guehi won't be thinking about January move,"Sky Sports News' Mark McAdam on the Transfer Show: ""January would mark the final opportunity Crystal Palace would have to make some money before seeing their captain leave on a free in the summer. ""There is still a chance they persuade him to stay. They did it with Michael Olise, why can't they do it with Marc Guehi. But, it's fair to say he won't be short of offers. In fact, they are all queuing up now, speaking with his representatives to see what a deal could look like. ""On January 1st, he can sign a pre-contract agreement with a club outside the Premier League. ""Every big club will want him. Every big club will want him. He’s a a captain, he’s a leader, he’s proven he can win silverware. ""He will probably be a key member of Thomas Tuchel's World Cup squad in the summer. And he's at the right age where he is not yet at his peak as a central defender. ""In terms of his position, he will be thinking of one thing and one thing only, Crystal Palace. He won't be thinking about a move in January. ""He'll be thinking if 'I play well from now until May, I will get huge money, a huge club and a huge opportunity to play at the highest level.'""",07/10/2025

It was agreed earlier this year but not announced by the club - and has been done to reflect his importance to the team. Arsenal are also understood to have made a similar move with Leandro Trossard’s contract earlier this year; improving the Belgian's salary but keeping the length of his deal the same until 2027.

Watford analysis: Pozzo has lofty ambitions,"Analysis from Sky Sports News' Anthony Joseph: Paulo Pezzolano is set to become the 12th manager Watford have sacked in just five years. He came in with high expectations and was billed as a “promotion specialist” - having reached the top division with clubs in Spain, Brazil and Uruguay. Owner Gino Pozzo has lofty ambitions of promotion to the Premier League and the club spent big in the transfer window, including the marquee signing of Nestory Irankunda from Bayern Munich. But it’s been a mixed start this season for Pezzolano - and it appears he hasn’t met the expectations of the club hierarchy. Watford fans chanted “you're getting sacked in the morning” as they trailed Portsmouth at half time last week. However, they did salvage a 2-2 draw at Fratton Park and followed it up with another comeback to beat Oxford United 2-1 at weekend. The club now sit in 11th place in the English Championship having won three, drawn three and lost three. They were knocked out of the EFL Cup in the first round to Norwich City. It’s understood Javi Gracia is the number one target to replace Pezzolano. He is due to fly to England for talks today. In his first spell at Vicarage Road, he steered the club to Premier League safety in 2018. The next season he took Watford to the FA Cup final and finished 11th in the league - their highest top-flight position since 1987. However, he was sacked in his third season - with the club sitting bottom of the Premier League in September 2019. That FA Cup run is still fairly fresh in the memory of the Watford support, who hold him in high regard. Gracia was last in charge of Leeds United, when he replaced Jesse Marsch in February 2023. The 55-year-old steered Leeds out of the relegation zone, but was relieved of his duties in May that year.",07/10/2025

Strasbourg among European clubs tracking Carvalho,"Latest from Sky Sports News' Lyall Thomas: Strasbourg are one of several European clubs continuing to track Fabio Carvalho's situation at Brentford. The French side, owned by BlueCo who also own Chelsea, have been interested in signing him in the last two transfer windows. Brentford were categorical that Carvalho was not available in the summer and head coach Keith Andrews has insisted he is part of his plans. But Carvalho has found regular games hard to come by and the likes of Lyon and Stuttgart are also watching his progress. Carvalho has been unlucky given the superb form of Mikkel Damsgaard and an array of other attacking players last season. Brentford have intended to play him this term and boss Andrews asked for ""patience"" after he scored the equaliser in the late draw against Chelsea in September. ""I’ve got a really good relationship with Fabio where he trusts me and knows that I believe in him,"" Andrews said. “I think the key with players is that you’ve got to be constantly in communication with them whether they’re playing or not. “When they’re not playing it’s obviously a bit more difficult, but you still have to communicate with them and speak to them about the game. “With Fabio I’ve just asked for a little bit of patience because I truly believe he will be a big player for this club.” Carvalho has played only four further minutes in the Premier League since Chelsea, although he missed the win over Manchester United with a minor injury. He has played the full 90 minutes in both Brentford’s Carabao Cup wins over Bournemouth and Aston Villa,  scoring against Bournemouth.",07/10/2025
Which of Klopp's midfield trio ranks as top signing?,"Sky Sports News' Vinny O'Connor: 1. Ryan Gravenberch The main individual success story since Arne Slot came in. He now looks an absolute bargain just over two years after he arrived from Bayern Munich for £34m and it's difficult to believe he’s still only 23. The key anchor of the Liverpool midfield  in last season’s title success, he’s more than just a screen in front of the Liverpool back four because his ability on the ball is as good as his ability to break things up. He can receive on the half turn, drive at the opposition and find the right pass. His opener in the Merseyside Derby is      a prime example of how impactful he can be at both ends of the pitch. 2. Dominic Szoboszlai The midfielder cost £60m in July 2023. His ability to get round the pitch at pace putting opposing players under pressure was a big feature of Liverpool’s press in their title success last season. A goal scorer in the back to back wins over City and Newcastle in February felt like real key contributions on the back of the draw at Aston Villa. This season it was his stunning free kick that snatched all three points against Arsenal at Anfield - and he’s still only 24. 3. Alexis Mac Allister His versatility has been needed since arriving from Brighton for £55m in June 2023, being able to play the No 6 role as well as further forward. His strike against Spurs at Anfield as Liverpool clinched the title won the club's goal of the season.",07/10/2025

Jesus a rogue shout for best signing?,"Sky Sports Nick Wright: Gabriel Jesus should be in the conversation for Arsenal's best signing of the last five years. Hear me out. Injuries have prevented the Brazil international from showing the kind of sensational form demonstrated in his first few months at the club consistently. His total of 26 goals in 96 games is undeniably modest. But his impact following his arrival from Manchester City in 2022 was transformative. The Gunners went from Champions League challengers to title contenders. He was the catalyst. Mikel Arteta said he changed their world. It was not just the Premier League title-winning experience he brought along with Oleksandr Zinchenko, but the way in which he attacked his new challenge and the quality he showed. Arsenal won 14 of the 16 games Jesus started before his knee injury in December 2022. It was thanks in large part to him that they were five points ahead of Manchester City at the top of the Premier League at the time. The team has evolved in his absence since then, with more setbacks bringing more spells on the sidelines. But Arsenal's trajectory might have been very different without him.",07/10/2025
Leeds monitoring winger market after failed Wilson move,"Latest from Sky Sports News' Zinny Boswell: Leeds United are understood to be monitoring the market for wingers ahead of the January transfer window after a Deadline Day move for Harry Wilson fell through. Nothing has changed regarding the club’s admiration for the Fulham player – but Leeds are realistic about their chances of reigniting a deal after Marco Silva said he was confident of agreeing a new contract with the Wales international. Wilson had shown an eagerness to move to Elland Road by signing a deal sheet – but that was when his already-limited game-time looked set to be reduced further by the additions of two new wingers Kevin and Samuel Chukwueze. However, Wilson has played in all seven of Fulham’s Premier League games so far this season – starting in five of them – and that will only strengthen the club’s pitch to the 28-year-old in talks over a new deal, with his current one expiring at the end of this season. Fulham also showed a reluctance to sell to Leeds over the summer in their pursuit of striker Rodrigo Muniz, due to not wanting to strengthen a rival in the Premier League. That only adds another potential layer of complication, though league position could shift that thinking. Leeds will have to be mindful of PSR if they do business in January. Managing director Robbie Evans said after the summer that “we are maxing PSR out this season” – and if their more expensive targets, such as Igor Paixao, had joined, others would have had to be sold. Barring any changes to the club’s PSR position before the window, loan signings present the most likely avenue for Leeds to strengthen in January and it is understood they will be attentive if any players of interest become available for a temporary move. Leeds are happy with their summer business after spending just over £100m on 10 signings to improve the spine of the team, although injuries to Dan James and Willy Gnonto early in the season have highlighted why there is a desire to add more depth out wide. The situation around targets could, of course, change between now and January depending on injuries, but there is a positive mood at Elland Road and a belief that so far Farke and his players have shown they can be competitive in the Premier League. Leeds have taken eight points from their first seven games back in the top-flight and sit four points above the relegation zone, with the battle to avoid the drop shaping up to be tighter than it has been for years.",07/10/2025
Arsenal's top three signings of the 2020s,"Sky Sports is asking the big question this midweek: who have been your Premier League club's best signings since 2020? Sky Sports News reporters have been selecting their top THREE Premier League signings for their respective club since the turn of the decade. Sky Sports' Sam Blitz: 1. Gabriel Go look back at an Arsenal line-up five years ago and the only Mikel Arteta purchase who is still around today is Gabriel. Since his arrival in the summer of 2020, Mikel Arteta has changed every part of the defence – bringing in William Saliba from exile, adding Ben White and Jurrien Timber on the right, plus countless left-backs signed. But Gabriel has been the one constant. The Brazilian has ultimately epitomised the modern-day Arsenal under their manager – excellent defensively but also a threat from set pieces. His total of 18 goals from set plays is six more than any other defender and, as Jamie Carragher pointed out recently, he is performing at the same level as his centre-back partner Saliba. 2. Declan Rice Declan Rice’s signing also cannot be understated. His £105m price tag – which saw Arsenal beat Bayern Munich and Manchester City to his signature – was a defining moment that solidified Arsenal’s spot as a top Premier League team again. Then his two free-kicks earned the eye-catching 3-0 win over Real Madrid, which in turn rubberstamped the Gunners’ status as a top team in Europe. 3. David Raya David Raya pips Martin Odegaard to third place, as it was a major call from Arteta, which underlined the Arsenal manager’s ruthlessness. Aaron Ramsdale was a popular figure at Arsenal but Arteta’s constant pursuit of higher standards, as well as his bold personality, was evident in this transfer. And Arteta came out on top in the debate, with Raya now in the top two or three goalkeepers in the world on current form.",07/10/2025

Can anyone beat Haaland into top spot at City?,"Sky Sportsis asking the big question this midweek: who has been your Premier League club's best signings since 2020? Sky Sports News reporters have been selecting their top THREE Premier League signings for their respective club since the turn of the decade. Sky Sports News' Ben Ransom: 1. Erling Haaland Man City took the best striker in the world from under the noses of Barcelona, Real Madrid and just about every top club going. His goals then helped them win the treble in his first season. He is still the most feared No.9 in world football and having another superb start to the campaign this time too. 2. Gianluigi Donnarumma Replacing Ederson was always going to be a huge challenge, until City beat the Deadline Day buzzer to get the man recently voted as the best GK at the Ballon D’Or.  It says something about some of City’s recent transfer windows that the new-arrival makes an instant appearance in my top 3, but a bit like Haaland he’s best-in-class and would walk into almost every other team in the country. 3. Ruben Dias City tracked the combative central defender for a long-time before finally getting their man in the Autumn of 2020.  Back then, aged just 23, Dias was already captain of Benfica and those leadership qualities helped drive City to four consecutive Premier League titles, as well as their first Champions League trophy.",07/10/2025

City made a number of significant signings in January 2025, including Khusanov, mainly due to the difficulties they were having in the Premier League last season. And it would likely take a similar situation to force the same level of investment in the squad this upcoming winter window. City made four new outfield additions in the summer in Tijjani Reijnders, Rayan Ait Nouri, Rayan Cherki and youngster Sverre Nypan, who joined Middlesbrough on loan.

It was announced at the start of September that Spurs’ majority owners ENIC had “unequivocally rejected” two expressions of interest in acquiring the north London club, with one from a consortium of investors led by Dr Roger Kennedy and Wing-Fai Ng through Firehawk. Amanda Staveley’s PCP International Finance immediately confirmed via the London Stock Exchange on September 8 that it did not intend to make an offer for Tottenham and Firehawk followed suit a month later. On September 26, Tottenham's majority shareholder ENIC had received and unequivocally rejected an informal expression of interest in buying the club from a consortium led by Mr Earick. A source close to the Lewis family told Sky Sports News last month: “This unsolicited and unnecessary interest does nothing to change the family’s resolve and commitment to do whatever it takes to drive success on the pitch. The club is not for sale.”",06/10/2025

The 22-year-old defender completed a move to the Bundesliga side in a deal worth up to £35m this summer after rising through the academy at Liverpool. ""As a young centre back, you need games to improve. I have always been learning from the best players around me,"" Quansah said. ""It has been so good for my career but as a young centre back, I'm 22 turning 23, I am going to be needing hundreds of games to be where I want to be. ""Overall, that is why the decision was made. That is why going abroad was best for me."" When asked about Liverpool's current struggles, he added: ""I am not part of Liverpool anymore but I know it was an unbelievable team last summer. ""It won't change a lot in a few months. I had to make that step because I wanted game time. ""I just wanted somewhere where they can trust I might make mistakes but I can develop.""",06/10/2025

'Postecoglou under serious pressure ahead of Newcastle clash',"Ange Postecoglou's position at Nottingham Forest is already under threat after just 24 days, according to reports. Forest have failed to win their last six matches since the former Tottenham boss' arrival and club owner Evangelos Marinakis is said to be concerned with recent performances. It is believed this weekend's game against Newcastle will be vital for Postecoglou's reign and that another poor outcome could spell the end of his time at the City Ground. Ahead of Sunday’s trip to Newcastle - live on Sky Sports - Postecoglou insisted he feels secure in his job. He said: “It’s a valid assumption in modern football that there is always a manager that is under pressure. That’s just part and parcel of what we do, but I don’t think that way. “Put it this way: I knew I was getting sacked at Tottenham about three or four months before I did, but that didn’t stop me from winning something. It doesn’t enter my head. “My responsibility lies in making sure this football club progresses and gets to a position where it can challenge for things. ""If I start putting timelines to that or worry about what is going to happen next week then I am not performing the role I have been given. I just don’t think it is helpful to anyone.”",03/10/2025
'Really fake news' - Glasner opens up on contract situation,"Crystal Palace head coach Oliver Glasner says he has not been offered a new contract yet by the Eagles amid intense speculation about his future. Rumours emerged online that Glasner had rejected a new offer from Palace, with the Austrian's contract due to expire at the end of the season. Sky Sports News reported on Thursday that while an offer is yet to be made, Palace are set to ramp up their talks with Glasner during the international break. “There are so many rumours and factors,” Glasner said on Friday, “We didn’t talk about a contract, I haven’t been offered a contract so I therefore cannot reject a contract offer. That is the situation. “We are so focused on performing and there are no talks at the moment about my contract situation. That’s my situation. Everything else is really fake news.”",03/10/2025

Timber has emerged as a key player Arsenal since doing his ACL in his Premier League debut for the club, which forced him out for virtually his entire debut campaign. ""The players want to be with us, we want to attach our futures with them,"" said Arteta. ""Jurrien is a really good example of someone under very difficult circumstances, with an injury early in his career, a difficult one - the way he's come back and what he's doing for the team, it's phenomenal.

Antony: I was treated with lack of respect before Man Utd exit,"Former Manchester United star Antony says he was treated with “a lack of respect” and “rudeness” after being frozen out of Ruben Amorim’s plans. The 25-year-old Brazil international was part of the so-called ‘bomb squad’ at United of players deemed surplus to requirements and available for sale in the summer. He ultimately joined Spanish side Real Betis, who he had initially played for on loan in the second half of last season. Antony told ESPN Brasil he “takes responsibility” for his move to United not working out as hoped, but has expressed discontent at how certain individuals treated him at Old Trafford. “I’m not the kind of guy who gets involved in controversies, who names people, in fact, I won’t mention anyone’s name here,” he said. “But I think there was a bit of a lack of respect there, even a bit of rudeness too, with no one giving you a ‘good morning’, a ‘good afternoon’. “Not even that. But, anyway, that’s in the past, I won’t give much importance to these things. Now I’m here, at Betis, I’m living here, that’s the most important thing for me.”",03/10/2025

The triumph in the Club World Cup and the summer transfer window of investment left some tipping Maresca's side to push for the Premier League title. There is still time, of course, but the early signs have not been promising.

Howe: Anderson’s Newcastle departure is very regretful,"Eddie Howe has admitted he would “love” to have Elliot Anderson back at Newcastle. The 22-year-old academy graduate found himself at the centre of a transfer window drama during the summer of 2024 when the Magpies reluctantly sold him to Nottingham Forest for £35m in an ultimately successful bid to avoid Premier League sanctions under profitability and sustainability rules. Anderson has since established himself as a fixture in Forest’s midfield and as a member of Thomas Tuchel’s England squad to leave his hometown club wondering what might have been as he prepares to line up against them at St James’ Park this weekend. Asked if he could see Anderson returning to Tyneside one day, head coach Howe said: “I don’t know, but certainly from my perspective I would love him to. “I’m very respectful of the fact he is at another football club and I would never normally talk about a player in that way, so I won’t change that stance. “But yes, it is very regretful a player from the academy who had given so much – and the club had given so much too, the coaching staff, all those years here and how people tried to develop those talents – for him not to be utilised here is a real shame.” Anderson’s departure, along with that of Yankuba Minteh to Brighton, dug the Magpies out of a financial hole, but in effect, they received only £15m for one of their brightest prospects after they paid £20m for goalkeeper Odysseas Vlachodimos, currently on loan at Sevilla, to make the deal happen. Asked if Forest got a bargain, Howe said: “Yes, we knew that. We knew that the minute it was going to happen, or likely to happen, that we were massively selling him at a big discount. “But the position we were in, we weren’t in a very strong negotiating position at all, and it was that or a points deduction. I’ve said many times we had no choice but to make the sale, but it was not one we wanted to do.”",03/10/2025

Howe on links to Man Utd: 'I'm all in at Newcastle',"Eddie Howe has insisted he is “100 per cent” committed to Newcastle amid speculation over Ruben Amorim’s future at Manchester United. The 47-year-old’s name has been mentioned as part of an ongoing debate surrounding Amorim’s tenure at Old Trafford, as he was when the England job became available after Gareth Southgate’s exit. However, asked about his commitment to the Magpies, Howe said: “My commitment here is I’m all in. I’m 100 per cent here, I always have been. My family are still here, we’re fighting every day to try to make a success of what we’re doing. “The season ahead could be a wonderful thing and that’s really what I want to focus on, trying to make a success of the games we have coming up.” Howe was appointed as Steve Bruce’s replacement in November 2021 a matter of weeks after Amanda Staveley’s consortium completed its buy-out at St James’ Park. The former Bournemouth boss took over a team fighting a relegation battle, but kept them up in some comfort and, aided by significant investment from its Saudi-backed owners, have kicked on. Newcastle are playing in the Champions League for the second time in three seasons and, in March, ended their 70-year wait for a major domestic trophy when Howe guided them to Carabao Cup final glory.",03/10/2025

Fans give verdict on Postecoglou,"Sky Sports’ Adam Bate at the City Ground following Nottingham Forest's 3-2 defeat to FC Midtjylland: The atmosphere at the end was unpleasant, hardly how Nottingham Forest had wanted their big night to reach its denouement. It had begun with nostalgia and pyrotechnics. Forest are back. It concluded in acrimony with calls for Ange Postecoglou to depart. He is six games into this job so on one level it is absurd. And yet, given the popularity of his predecessor and the underwhelming reaction to his appointment, he needed an encouraging start to convince the doubters. Instead, he has not won a single game. Arsenal away was a daunting start but a cup tie against Swansea, two matches against promoted teams, and an inviting fixture at home to Danish opposition in a Europa League they kicked off among the favourites to win, provided a real opportunity for him. Instead, despite dominating possession in those games, he has been unable to offer a vision of how he can improve Forest. Indeed, some might argue it is because of dominating possession in those games. This was not what their success was built on. Perhaps Forest have to evolve away from their counter-attacking approach, add more to their repertoire if they are to progress. But for now, it seems they have lost what made them so good without adding anything of note. Too passive. Uncertain in both boxes. Postecoglou insists they are on the right track, but the sense at the City Ground on Thursday evening was that few would agree with that sentiment right now. Regardless of the coach, there would be concerns. But for many fans, the verdict on Postecoglou is in.",03/10/2025

Arteta defends Gyokeres and insists goals will come,"Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta is confident the goals will soon start to flow for Viktor Gyokeres. Sweden striker Gyokeres has drawn a blank in his last five matches having been frustrated again in Wednesday’s 2-0 Champions League win over Olympiacos.

Malacia back in first team training after Amorim talks,"Latest from Sky Sports News' Danyal Khan: Tyrell Malacia has been reintegrated into Manchester United's first team and was seen training with the squad for the first time today. This was always the plan and timeline for Malacia to rejoin the first team. Malacia met with manager Ruben Amorim earlier this week after he had been training with U23s in recent weeks. The 26-year-old's attitude has been described as outstanding with United's reserve squad and requested to feature for the side before he was reintegrated back into the first team. Malacia had trained separately away from the main group since pre-season, with a move away from the club failing to materialise in the summer. The Dutchman can, although of course unlikely, feature for United immediately in the league as he was in their squad list submitted at the start of the season. Malacia hasn't featured for United in the Premier League since January 26.",01/10/2025

Shankland put himself in the frame for a recall ahead of October’s World Cup qualifiers against Greece and Belarus after hitting seven goals in his first 10 matches of the season. However, Scotland head coach Steve Clarke named a very settled squad after starting the campaign with four points from two matches and stuck with Che Adams, Lyndon Dykes, Kieron Bowie and George Hirst as his strike options. Shankland has scored three goals in 16 internationals with his most recent appearance coming in November last year. When asked if he was surprised Shankland had not made the cut, McInnes said: “I was hoping that he would be and I had a brief chat with Lawrence on the back of the conversation I had with Steve. “But Scotland’s two strikers particularly did well last time out and Steve said that, he was pleased with Dykes and Adams, and there are another couple of strikers. “Listen, the motivation for Lawrence and all the players involved with Scotland, whether they are in this squad or not, is to try and get involved in a World Cup. “I don’t want Lawrence or anybody else to lose sight of that.”",30/09/2025

Howe defends Woltemade after Bayern comments,"Newcastle boss Eddie Howe has leapt to Nick Woltemade's defence after Bayern Munich executive Karl-Heinz Rummenigge claimed Stuttgart had found ""an idiot"" to pay £69m for him. The 23-year-old Germany international arrived at St James' Park for a club record fee on deadline day as the Magpies reinvested some of the £130m they had raked in for Alexander Isak. Bayern were also engaged in the race to sign Woltemade, but ultimately had to admit defeat, prompting Rummenigge to tell Blickpunkt Sport: ""I congratulate Stuttgart, because they found an idiot who paid the money we didn't want to pay in Munich."" Asked about the former Germany frontman's comments as he conducted his pre-match press conference in Brussels ahead of Wednesday night's Champions League clash with Union Saint-Gilloise, head coach Howe said: ""The market forces dictate transfer fees, not necessarily any one club. We're very pleased to have Nick with us. ""I think he's started very strongly in what's been a difficult period for him because he's thrust straight into action, no training time with us, really, of any note and I think he's done really, really well, so we're really pleased to have him with us and the transfer fee, for me, is absolutely irrelevant."" Woltemade has scored two goals in his three Premier League appearances to date as he gets to grip with life in England's top tier and will hope for a first Champions League start against the Belgian champions. He could be forgiven for feeling the weight of his hefty price tag, but Howe is confident that will not be an issue. He said: ""I don't think he's that kind of character. I don't think he necessarily over-thinks things too much, which is a really big strength. ""What he's going to be judged on is how he performs in the team and what he gives to the club going forward.""",30/09/2025

The 26-year-old had been part of the so-called ‘bomb squad’ of players United had deemed surplus to requirements in the summer, along with Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho and Antony. While the other four left the club, Malacia remained at United after a loan move to Spanish side Elche fell through. He has been training with the under-21s but the PA news agency understands he has now been reintegrated with the senior squad. Sources close to the club said this was a planned change and not in response to United’s form or to injuries suffered by other players. Malacia joined United in 2022, becoming the first signing of Erik ten Hag’s reign as head coach. He was a regular for the Red Devils in the 2022-23 season but suffered a long-term knee injury towards the end of that campaign which forced him to miss the whole of the 2023-24 season. He joined PSV Eindhoven on loan in the second half of last season, having featured eight times under Ruben Amorim prior to that.",30/09/2025

Ekitike joined from Frankfurt in a deal worth £69m plus a potential £10m in add-ons and has hit the ground running, scoring five goals in eight appearances in all competitions. But Liverpool maintained a strong interest in Newcastle sharpshooter Isak throughout the summer and got their man for a British record £125m on deadline day. “I think it’s good with players in such a big club,” Ekitike said. “I can’t see one big club playing with only one striker, so I think it’s good that he’s here. “Even for me at my age, I think I still have a lot of things to improve and learn, so for me it’s good that he’s here. “(As for if we can play together) that’s for the coach to decide how he wants to play.

Maybe the offer was not good enough for the club, I don’t know. “But of course, at his age, last season he played a lot of minutes. He can play on both sides, right and left, has pace that is unbelievable. So in that term, he’s really good.” Savinho is in line to follow a number of Guardiola’s squad in signing fresh terms. Nico O’Reilly was the latest player to sign a new contract on Friday, coming after new deals for Ruben Dias and Rico Lewis in recent weeks. “It’s happened with Rico, Nico…Savinho is close, and in the past, Ruben has done it as well,” Guardiola said. “So we’ll try to be sure to show a player that we want him. Do the effort that we need to stay a bit longer. So I’m really pleased. “Nico is growing a lot. I think since he started to play, we lost just one game. The final FA Cup against Palace. “When he’s not been involved it was defeats all the time. So Nico helped us a lot, improved a lot in his aggressivity and set pieces and with the ball. We’re really, really pleased.”",29/09/2025
Rooney has no faith in Ruben Amorim to turn things around at United,"Wayne Rooney has no faith in Ruben Amorim to turn things around at Manchester United and believes the soul has gone from his former club. Head coach Amorim has taken 34 points from his 33 Premier League games in charge following Saturday’s 3-1 loss at Brentford and is yet to oversee consecutive top-flight wins. Rooney, United’s all-time leading goalscorer, said he goes to games expecting the team to lose and feels some players do not deserve to represent the club. Despite the ongoing poor form, which includes last month’s Carabao Cup exit at League Two Grimsby, Amorim reportedly retains the backing of United’s board. “I just don’t know what’s going on,” Rooney said. “I have tried my hand in management and it didn’t work out too well, so I get it. Ruben Amorim is my age, he’s still a young manager and I’m sure he’s got a massive future, but what’s going on at Man Utd, this is not Man Utd. “I honestly hope he can turn it round and he does. But…after everything I’ve seen, honestly, I’ve got no faith in it.”",29/09/2025
Nuno looking for fast start to life at West Ham,"Nuno Espirito Santo knows he needs to hit the ground running when he takes charge of West Ham for the first time at Everton on Monday Night Football. The 51-year-old was confirmed as the Hammers’ new head coach on Saturday, just four hours after Graham Potter was sacked, and took training later that afternoon. Nuno, who was axed by Nottingham Forest less than three weeks ago, inherits a side lying 19th in the Premier League having lost four of their five matches and been knocked out of the Carabao Cup by Wolves. “I’m trying to, as soon as possible, know all the players,” he told West Ham TV. “I think I know them better than they know me, because it’s like that. We are coaches and we try to take all the info that we can about the players. “Many of them, we faced each other before and now it’s preparing for the game, a tough game against Everton.”",29/09/2025

Nuno was No 1 option - but is he right for West Ham?,"Sky Sports News' Kaveh Solhekol: ""We were told on Thursday by a very senior source that the next West Ham manager was going to be Nuno Espirito Santo. Perhaps the timing would have been better to wait until the international break because West Ham have got this difficult game away at Everton, followed by a game away at Arsenal. But it looks like it's going to be Nuno taking over. Other names who were linked were Slaven Bilic, Gary O’Neil and Sean Dyche. ""Our information all along was that Nuno was the number one target. The big question is:  Is he the right man for the job? Because this is a massive job, there are problems off the pitch, and there are issues with the London Stadium. ""It’s undeniable that Nuno is a fantastic manager, but is he the right manager for West Ham? Will his style of football suit West Ham? ""A lot of people in the game say Nuno is a fantastic manager when your side doesn’t have the ball; he’s good at counter-attacking football, but will that suit West Ham? Do West Ham have the kind of players that can play that football, or are they good enough defensively, like Nuno's sides at Forest and Wolves were? ""We know he was the manager of Spurs for a short while, which didn’t work, but if he does the kind of job he did at Forest, then he will potentially be a success. ""The first thing he needs to do if he gets the job is sort West Ham out defensively, stop them from conceding so many corners and get them out of the relegation zone.""",27/09/2025
Guardiola ‘fine’ with manner of Walker’s Man City exit,"Pep Guardiola insists the way Kyle Walker’s time at Manchester City came to an end should do nothing to take away from his achievements during an eight-year spell with the club. Walker won six Premier League titles and the Champions League among 15 major honours with City but asked to leave the club in January, heading for a loan spell with AC Milan before signing a two-year deal in the summer to join Saturday’s opponents Burnley. Walker, who had been made club captain last summer, left City midway through the season in which Guardiola’s side fell well short of their usual standards before rallying to finish third in the Premier League. But Guardiola insisted he had no issue with Walker or the manner of his departure as he praised the 35-year-old as one of the best full-backs ever. “I would have loved the best Kyle (last season) but he was unhappy for reasons, or when I take a situation for a family reason or from his life,” Guardiola said. “Obviously, you know all of you, sometimes I take a decision, but when the player isn’t happy or satisfied and cannot be there it’s my job and I have an agreement with the club. For me it’s fine.” Walker, who had signed a new contract with City only last September, had been appointed captain by his team-mates in keeping with a system long used by Guardiola. But ahead of this season the Catalan chose to name his own skipper as he handed the armband to Bernardo Silva, with Ruben Dias, Rodri and Erling Haaland as vice-captains. Guardiola insisted his change in approach was nothing to do with Walker’s exit. “Absolutely not,” he said. “I never put responsibility on what happened on one person, so that’s why I never choose just one or team chooses just one (captain), there’s a lot of them in that position. “What happened last season, many things happened, not just for one person. It never happened for one person, absolutely. (The) captain left, there’s many reasons why, and then there are other captains but it’s a good lesson, so life is like that. “It happens many times, many things, during one season, you just learn from that, and this season I decided that, and maybe next season I will decide completely the opposite.”",27/09/2025
West Ham sack Potter,"Graham Potter has been sacked by West Ham after just nine months in charge. Potter, who replaced Julen Lopetegui as head coach on a two-and-a-half-year contract in January, has been unable to turn the fortunes around at the London Stadium, with the club second-bottom of the Premier League. A club statement on Saturday morning - two days before their Monday Night Football game with Everton - read: ""West Ham United can confirm that head coach Graham Potter has left the club. ""Results and performances over the course of the second half of last season and the start of the 2025/26 season have not matched expectations, and the board of directors believe that a change is necessary in order to help improve the team's position in the Premier League as soon as possible.""

Frank says Tottenham owners want to achieve ‘something special’,"Thomas Frank believes the current Tottenham owners are “120 per cent” committed to achieving something special after a third expression of interest to buy the club was rejected. Spurs addressed media speculation over a proposed £4.5billion takeover bid on Friday with a statement via the London Stock Exchange that majority owners ENIC – run by the Lewis family trust – “is not looking to sell its stake” in the club. The statement confirmed an informal expression of interest to acquire shares in Tottenham by a consortium led by American tech entrepreneur Brooklyn Earick had been “unequivocally rejected” by ENIC. ENIC issued a similar statement earlier this month which confirmed expressions of interest by Amanda Staveley’s PCP International Finance and a consortium of investors led by Dr Roger Kennedy and Wing-Fai Ng through Firehawk Holdings Limited were also rejected. Takeover speculation has increased since the sudden departure of Daniel Levy on September 4 after 24 years as chairman. It was a move designed to help Tottenham target “more wins, more often” according to a source close to the Lewis family. Ahead of Saturday’s visit of Wolves, the third home fixture since a restructure of key roles which has left the Lewis family trust with greater power, Frank talked up their long-term ambitions. Frank said: “Very, very invested. 120 per cent committed to the club. “They really want to achieve something special, want to build and want to add. Again, I think I like the phrase building layers because you never go to the top. You can’t jump five steps. That’s impossible. “So, building layers, I think, is very important. I think that’s also more organic and more sustainable over time, but they’re very, very focused on what they can do to help the club.”",27/09/2025
Record-breaker Kane 'really happy' at Bayern amid transfer talk,"Harry Kane says he is ""really happy"" at Bayern Munich. The England captain broke a record held by Cristiano Ronaldo and Erling Haaland by scoring his 100th Bundesliga goal in just his 104th appearance in the competition as Bayern beat Werder Bremen on Friday night. That meant he'd reached three figures in a top-five league faster than any other player, with Ronaldo and Haaland taking 105 games to reach 100 goals for Real Madrid and Man City, respectively. Afterwards the striker played down recent talk he could be leaving Bayern in January or at the end of the season by telling Sky Germany: ""I’m really happy here at Bayern. I have two years left on my contract. And to be honest, I’m enjoying every minute. ""I enjoy playing here in front of the fans. I enjoy the team, the coach. So that’s not on my mind at all. I’m just looking forward to this season and hope we’ll be successful.""",26/09/2025

Joelinton: Isak departure won't derail Newcastle's season,"Joelinton has insisted Alexander Isak's departure will not derail Newcastle's season. The saga surrounding the 26-year-old Sweden international's big-money move to Liverpool rumbled on for much of the summer before eventually coming to a head on Deadline Day. However, Brazil midfielder Joelinton will not linger on the disappointment of losing a man who had played such a key role in the club's recent rise as he plots a path to further success. He said: ""We are professional. We came back to the club to do our best. ""We had a good pre-season. We know the noise around, but we are professional. We kept the focus and do what we have to do on the pitch, and everyone has done well. ""We wish Alex the best. He did well for the club and now he's gone and we have to focus on the players that are here in the squad and keep going."" The Isak transfer boosted the Magpies' coffers to the tune of £130million, muchof which has since been invested in record £69m signing Nick Woltemade and YoaneWissa, who cost a further £55m. Woltemade's lack of Premier League experience and Wissa's knee injury means Howe's new-look frontline remains a work in progress. He said: ""They are both great players with a lot of quality and are going to add a lot to the squad. ""Nick is doing well so far. Wiss is unlucky to pick up the injury, but we hope he's going to recover quickly. We believe in ourselves and know we can play against anyone. ""When he starts to play, we will try to help him and hope he settles quickly and scores a lot of goals for us.""",26/09/2025

Liverpool teenager Ngumoha signs first professional contract,"Liverpool teenager Rio Ngumoha has signed his first professional contract with the club. Sky Sports News understands the 17-year-old has signed a three-year deal at Anfield. FIFA regulations state that under-18s cannot sign contracts for longer than this length. Last month, the 17-year-old became the youngest scorer in Liverpool's history as he scored a stoppage-time winner in the 3-2 Premier League win at Newcastle, aged 16 years and 361 days old. The winger's goal also made him the fourth youngest scorer in Premier League history, behind James Vaughan, James Milner and Wayne Rooney. Ngumoha was born in Newham in East London on August 29, 2008. He joined Chelsea’s academy at the age of eight and moved to Liverpool in the summer of 2024. The England U19 international has made five senior appearances for Liverpool, with the most recent coming in Tuesday's Carabao Cup third-round win over Southampton as he started in the 2-1 win at Anfield. Ngumoha made his debut in the FA Cup third-round tie at home to Accrington in January and after impressing in pre-season was made a permanent member of head coach Arne Slot’s first-team squad.

Man Utd sign pre-agreement for Colombian starlet,"Latest from Sky Sports News' Rob Dorsett: Manchester United have signed a pre-contract agreement with Fortaleza in Colombia for 17-year-old Cristian Orozco.

He was part of the Colombia side that reached the final of the CONMEBOL South American Championships this summer, and United have high hopes for him in the future. It is expected that Orozco will officially move to Old Trafford in July, once he has turned 18. The South American market is a particularly attractive one for United, where the data shows there is an abundance of youth talent available at good value. The club has already signed 18-year-old full back Diego Leon from Paraguayan side Cerro Porteno in July, after agreeing a similar pre-contract agreement with him last January.

Palace accept Guehi's time is coming to an end,"Latest from Sky Sports News' James Savundra, Kaveh Solhekol and Mark McAdam: Crystal Palace realistically accept that Marc Guehi's time at the club is coming to an end.

Guehi is calm about his next steps having seen his deadline day move to Liverpool collapse. The two sides meet at Selhurst Park on Saturday after the Reds came close to sealing a £35m purchase of Guehi at the start of this month. There's a sense that the England defender is equally likely to leave in January as he is to depart as a free agent next summer. A fresh approach from Liverpool to sign Guehi in January cannot be ruled out. Liverpool centre-back Giovanni Leoni faces months out with a torn cruciate ligament, according to Sky in Italy. However, Palace would not allow Guehi to leave on the cheap in the winter window. The 25-year-old can sign a pre-contract agreement with a foreign club in January.

Guardiola feels ‘bad’ for not playing Phillips more,"Pep Guardiola admits he feels bad for not giving Kalvin Phillips more playing time at Manchester City. The midfielder made a big-money move from Leeds to the Etihad in 2022 but has made only two Premier League starts for Guardiola’s side, while loan spells at West Ham and Ipswich have also proved difficult. Sky Sports Phillips, who has not played for City since December 2023, is now back training with City after an Achilles injury scuppered his chances of a summer move. Asked why it had not worked out at City for the 29-year-old, Guardiola said: “It’s a good question. Maybe because I didn’t give enough minutes. “In that moment, Rodri was fit and looks like our father in that time, protecting the other 10 sons. Maybe the way we played, it was completely different to Leeds. “Always I believe in that level, all the players are really, really good. It’s just the environment, how they connect with the way we play. And the players play good when they have games, games, games, and I didn’t give them. “When that happens, I feel bad, but he’s an incredible person. Now he’s come back here. He will train with us, we’ll try to help him and maybe he can play some games and get confident.”",24/09/2025

The £34.6 million signing was substituted late on with what appeared to be a shoulder injury, a worrying sign ahead of Saturday’s trip to Aston Villa. “Let’s see what’s going to happen,” said Silva. “He kept feeling the pain there. “Kevin is in a process. He arrived 23 days ago. The first 10 days, he was training with 11 players here [during the international break]. You can imagine how long it will take. “He’s very talented, he has something different in terms of profile. He needs time to understand his team-mates and understand the kind of football he’s going to play. Football is different here to in other countries. “He knows he has strong competition in the wide areas of the pitch. The more minutes he has, the more he is going to adapt.”",24/09/2025

Sterling posted a picture on social media this week of a night-time training session, but that is something that happens very rarely. Multiple groups of players train at different times at Chelsea’s Cobham training ground and for scheduling reasons, that was an evening session.

"PFA contact Chelsea over Disasi, Sterling situations","The Professional Footballers’ Association have contacted Chelsea to make sure Raheem Sterling and Axel Disasi are being treated according to the terms of their contracts. Both players are training away from the first-team squad after failing to secure moves away during the summer window. Sterling has two years left on his £325,000 a week contract. Napoli and Bayern Munich were interested in signing him but he wanted to stay based in London for family reasons. Chelsea are working closely with the PFA and the players are training regularly. They have a dedicated coach as part of their sporting plan. Chelsea will try to find the players new clubs when the window opens in January. FIFA’s rules state that players who are excluded from squads under conditions which constitute ‘abusive conduct’ could be allowed to terminate their contracts. Cheslea head coach Enzo Maresca confirmed last Friday that the two players were not part of his plans. They train at different times from the first team and use a different pitch, dressing room and gym. “They are Chelsea players, but they are training separately and the plan is to continue this way,” Maresca said. “Since the season started, I haven’t seen either of them.” Sterling moved to Chelsea from Manchester City in a £50m deal in June 2022.

""I'll only stop when I feel that something has changed,"" he said. ""And today I feel that I am hungrier than I was 25 years ago."" Mourinho started his coaching career at Benfica in 2000 but lasted only three months before leaving in a contract dispute. ""I'm now the coach of one of the greatest clubs in the world,"" he said.

PSG: Donnarumma left over contract demands,"PSG have confirmed that Gianluigi Donnarumma left this summer because they could not agree a new contract with the Italy goalkeeper. Donnarumma moved to Manchester City in a £26m move on Deadline Day and he was in typically impressive form on his debut against Manchester United on Sunday. PSG decided to cash in on Donnarumma because they did not want to lose him on a free transfer when his contract was due to expire next summer. Speaking to RMC Sport, sporting director Luis Campos said: “The club’s policy is to build a team more important than any individual. ""Gianluigi Donnarumma asked for a salary at the level of the old PSG, not the current PSG. Our policy is closely tied to sporting performances, you earn more when you deserve it. ""Gianluigi was the first player we approached about an extension, but we quickly understood that it will be difficult due to his demands. ""We both took time to discuss Gianluigi’s situation - it’s a set of circumstances that led to his departure.” Donnarumma is likely to make his Champions League debut for City on Thursday against Napoli.

It is claimed the England international was desperate to leave Old Trafford in the summer after falling out of favour with boss Ruben Amorim, but United blocked an exit. Newcastle boss Eddie Howe is reportedly an admirer of Mainoo and would consider testing United’s resolve if the 21-year-old remains in the cold. The Man Utd academy graduate came off the bench in Sunday's 3-0 loss at Manchester City and is yet to start a Premier League game this season, with his only start coming in the Carabao Cup loss at Grimsby.

Robertson promises to fight for starting spot at Liverpool,"Liverpool vice-captain Andy Robertson is not ready to sit on the sidelines and relinquish his position as first-choice left-back without a fight after admitting there was a chance he could have left for Atletico Madrid in the summer. The 31-year-old has been displaced in the starting line-up this season by £40m signing Milos Kerkez, 10 years his junior. He was briefly linked with a move to Atletico, coincidentally Liverpool’s first Champions League opponents on Wednesday, but opted to remain at Anfield for the final year of his contract despite knowing he was most likely going to be a back-up. Robertson came off the bench 38 minutes into the 1-0 win at Burnley which extended Liverpool’s 100 percent record to four matches as head coach Arne Slot was concerned Kerkez, already on a booking, was in danger of being sent off in what has been a scratchy start at his new club. The Scotland captain, who played in the recent draw with Denmark and win over Belarus, brought an immediate improvement down the left side to provide a reminder he is far from a spent force. Asked whether there was a chance he could have been lining up against the Reds for the Spanish visitors on Wednesday, Robertson said: “Maybe at one point. “I do want to play games and be the starting left-back and I have got to keep pushing to try to produce the levels I know I can do. “The international break was good for me as I was able to get two 90 minutes, get that match fitness and two really good results for Scotland and I took a lot of confidence from that.""",15/09/2025

Rodgers wants Maeda to park Celtic exit disappointment,"Brendan Rodgers has backed talismanic forward Daizen Maeda to park any disappointment about not securing a move away from Celtic. The Japanese revealed on international duty last week that he hoped to leave the Hoops before the transfer deadline but a proposed move was blocked because the club were unable to source adequate replacements. Rodgers said: “I wasn’t surprised by that [revelation from Maeda] because I’ve known since the end of February where Daizen was at. “We spoke a lot and he’s continued to give everything in his game and his training. He had a few options to go and it would have been great for him and his family in terms of his life, but it didn’t materialise, so it’s now my job to convince him to go again. “I’ve done that with players before. I had Luis Suarez nearly at the end of my first season (at Liverpool) when it was deemed he was going to Arsenal. I had to convince him to stay and then he ended up having an amazing season and then after that went to Barcelona, so it’s not new to my career. “Players will have challenges but I think everyone sees the integrity of which Daizen works, how he plays and how if I can reconnect all of that again then I’m pretty sure he will give his all whilst he’s playing.” Rodgers, who has always been open to allowing players to move on when they express a desire to leave, admitted that in an ideal world Celtic would have been able to let Maeda, last season’s Premiership Player of the Year, move on. “I still feel that if a player does want to move on then we have to be prepared for that,” he said. “I think in this window we clearly weren’t prepared for it. It just couldn’t happen but my feelings are still the same. “Especially if you’ve got a player who’s been here for years giving his absolute all and he wants to have another challenge before maybe going back to Japan, then that was maybe the right thing for him. “But certainly the position we were in and it being so late, we couldn’t make that happen for him sadly.”",12/09/2025

So it’s part of the football world, part of the football business. “Once the player feels that it’s time to move on, then it’s best for all parties to find the best deal and then to move forward as a club.”",12/09/2025

Karlsson: Thelin reunion can boost my career,"Jesper Karlsson is hoping his reunion with Jimmy Thelin at Aberdeen can make his career “fly” again following his Deadline Day move from Bologna. Karlsson admitted the presence of Thelin, who was his manager at Elfsborg between 2018 and 2020, was key to his decision to join. “I have a good relationship with Jimmy since I played in Sweden, so this was a good choice for me,” he said in a club interview. “He was a big factor in me coming here. “I was young when he came in (at Elfsborg), but I remember well his way of treating players. Very professional, but also very good on the human side. “He made my career fly a bit when it was the same situation that I didn’t play. Then he was a little bit hard on me and then I started to play. “We had good times together in Sweden and we have kept in contact also when I was in Holland and Italy.”",11/09/2025

He played at Coventry, and I played loads of games with him at Brighton.

It's no secret I like my teams to attack, I love my teams to score goals.

""Other clubs that have won promotion have struggled to stay in the league, but in a short space of time we're back in Europe and competing for honours, which is a great credit to everyone involved.

Onana error sees Cameroon WC qualification hopes dented,"Manchester United shotstopper Andre Onana is under fire once again as his nation, Cameroon, suffered a 1-0 defeat to Cape Verde during their World Cup qualifying group fixture on Tuesday. Dailon Livramento tightened Cape Verde's grip on top spot, as he ran from the centre circle after dispossessing United-linked Carlos Baleba to finish past Onana as Cameroon were hit on the counter. The 29-year-old, who Sky Sports News understand has a broad agreement in place to join Trabzonspor in an imminent loan move, was rooted to his line as Livramento approached one-on-one. A video emerged on social media following the game, appearing to show a frustrated Onana shoving a fan who stormed the pitch at full-time. Defeat for Cameroon means their hopes of qualifying for the World Cup have been dented with two games. Cape Verde need three points to fully ensure their automatic World Cup qualification as they now boast a four-point gap over Cameroon in second. Onana's United team-mate, Bryan Mbeumo, played 87 minutes. Should Cameroon finish in second place in Group D, they will hope to enter the playoffs as one of the four best runners-up. At present, the Indomitable Lions are the fifth-best runner-up. Cameroon play Mauritius and Angola next month in a bid to keep their World Cup qualification dreams alive.",10/09/2025

""Forest have spent big on attackers in the summer, it's now up to the former Tottenham boss to unlock their potential.

Analysis: How changes under Edu and break down of trust led to Nuno departure,"Latest from Sky Sports News' Rob Dorsett: ""Nuno Espirito Santo got his wish, in the end. Even though he denied it, he wanted to be sacked. ""Evangelos Marinakis has now opted for a replacement head coach in his own image: Ange Postecoglou is a dominant man, head strong, principled, who doesn’t suffer fools gladly. ""Nuno was never going to resign, but he'd had enough of life at the City Ground. As soon as Marinakis appointed Edu as his global head of football, the writing was on the wall. ""Edu was officially appointed in June, but his influence over the Forest owner stretches back longer than that. Nuno saw Edu as the third wheel: an awkward middle-man, who meant that his symbiotic relationship with Marinakis was now one stage removed. ""He couldn’t understand why, when he and the Greek billionaire had always been so close, the owner had put a barrier in between them. ""There were significant differences of opinion over transfer policy too. Even before Edu’s arrival, Nuno never had much of a say over recruitment, but he was consulted and his opinion mattered. In truth, not much changed in that regard with Edu at the helm, but Nuno felt it had, and he was bitter. ""He has always liked a small, tight-knit squad to work with, but with European football and big ambitions, the owner and Edu knew they needed more strength in depth. ""After a season of real success, unparalleled in the previous three decades, the relationship between owner and head coach was shot. Nuno knew it, and he said so in two explosive news conferences. ""To criticise Marinakis in public once is brave, or foolish. To do it twice in seven days was terminal. The trust was gone, and Marinakis was furious. ""He could not understand why the manager, on the eve of the new season - a season where the fanbase and everyone connected with the club was more optimistic than they had been for years - why the club figurehead and leader of the football team would go nuclear, and cause unnecessary noise and disruption inside and outside the club. ""Once that trust was gone, it was impossible to find a way back, and Marinakis didn’t want to try. He had already moved on. ""Sky Sports News understands Marinakis is philosophical about what has happened, and sees this as a positive new step in the club’s evolution. ""Steve Cooper got the club back into the Premier League. Nuno got it back into Europe. Now, in Postecoglou, they believe they have a man at the helm who can take them to the next level - which is very clear in Marinakis’ eyes - he wants to win trophies. The ambition is relentless.""",09/09/2025

""I knew the news about Daniel Levy yesterday,"" Pochettino said. ""I am a little bit in shock, because he was my former president. I don't know what happened there.

Maeda reveals Celtic refused to let him leave this summer,"Daizen Maeda has revealed he hoped to leave Celtic in the summer transfer window closed but a proposed move was blocked by the Parkhead club. Last season’s Scottish Premiership Player of the Year was eager to take the “next step” in his career after receiving a tempting offer from elsewhere. Maeda, speaking while on international duty with Japan, said he was late in joining up with his country this week due to “club circumstances”, with the transfer window closing on Monday night. “I received an offer,” Maeda said. “I had been telling the club that I wanted to take the next step, but Celtic hadn’t been able to strengthen their squad properly, so in the end they told me they couldn’t let me go.” Maeda, who has scored 63 goals since joining Celtic in January 2022, had been linked with Brentford, but the 27-year-old refused to divulge if it was a Premier League club who tried to sign him. “Personally, I had agreed, so I wanted to take on the challenge,” he said. “The national team also delayed my joining, and I really asked Celtic until the last day, but it didn’t happen.” Maeda, who has another two years on his contract, has accepted that he will be remaining with Celtic at least until January. “I’ve decided to stay at Celtic, so I want to do my best as a member of the team,” the forward added. The sale of talisman Maeda would have heaped further pressure on the Celtic board at a time when they are already under fire from their supporters after being deemed to have failed to adequately replenish Brendan Rodgers’ attack following the departures of Kyogo Furuhashi, Adam Idah and Nicolas Kuhn this year.",05/09/2025

Aston Villa meet UEFA's requirements,"UEFA have confirmed that Aston Villa have met the transfer requirements imposed upon them after being fined earlier this year. Villa were fined £9.5m in July for failing to comply with UEFA rules which allows clubs to lose no more than £60m over a three-year period and not spend more than 80% of the club’s revenue on wages - a further £12.9m fine was conditional of compliance. Part of the requirement was for Villa to have a positive transfer balance by the end of the summer window, which was largely achieved by selling Jacob Ramsey to Newcastle for £39m. Villa could have been prevented from registered new players for the Europa League this season had they not met UEFA’s stipulations but summer signings Harvey Elliott, Jadon Sancho, Victor Lindelof, Evan Guessand and Marco Bizot were all included in the squad submitted yesterday.

DOF Giles: Wissa's public spat with Brentford 'not ideal',"Brentford director of football Phil Giles has admitted Yoane Wissa's public transfer saga before his eventual deadline day move to Newcastle was 'not ideal' - but insisted that ""in many ways"" the summer window had been no trickier than any other he has dealt with. Wissa was not involved in any of the Bees' first four games after refusing to train with his team-mates amid ongoing interest from the Magpies, before he eventually released a public demand to leave the club in the final days of the window - eventually getting his wish. “It’s been an interesting last few days and in fact, an interesting last few weeks,” Giles told Brentford's official website. ""The big story is selling Yoane Wissa. He was a fantastic player for us, started off playing wide and evolved to take on the No 9 position and had a brilliant season last year. “He was a really good, infectious character who was positive around the players and the fans. I personally liked him a lot as well, so there’s nothing but positive things to say about his performances on the pitch for us. “Transfers are always complicated. There’s always a little bit of emotion, friction and dialogue. That normally stays in house but obviously this one spilled out. It’s not the only one this summer that has spilled out a little bit more into the public domain which is, from my point of view, not ideal. “You have got to take the emotions out of it and got to ultimately make the decisions for the club. Every decision I make or we make collectively during a transfer window will strip all of the emotion out of it and focus purely on what is the right decision in this moment in time for the club overall. ""To some extent, it’s been no more difficult than many other transfer windows personally. “It maybe just slipped out publicly a little bit more this time than normal, so people got a bit more insight into how things tend to play out.""",02/09/2025

Asked if the notion of 'player power' is unfair on Gyokeres and Isak, the Arsenal forward replied: “We all play. And the clubs have the most power. Maybe it’s difficult for the players to choose in a lot of cases. “He doesn’t have any power, clubs can do what they want with a player.  It’s difficult but it’s how the situation is.”",02/09/2025

City completed a £26m deal to sign the Italy international on Tuesday, with Ederson being sold to Fenerbahce prior to his arrival. Carragher said: ""He’s a great goalkeeper, a great addition to the Premier League. I think the standard of goalkeeping over the past few years hasn’t been as high as it has been in the past. ""This is a guy who we unfortunately remembered from how good he was at the European Championships and winning Italy the trophy in 2021. ""Last season, with the Champions League, his performances against Liverpool were fantastic. But in his time at PSG, it hasn’t gone as he would have liked because there was a lot of criticism, particularly early on, for his actual goalkeeping. ""I don’t think Luis Enrique was ever a fan of how he was with his feet. ""Yes, we know Pep Guardiola wants that for all of his goalkeepers but it’s very difficult to find somebody who is fantastic with his feet and is also a fantastic goalkeeper. This guy was the best option out there for Guardiola. ""With Ederson leaving, they did have to bring in a goalkeeper. James Trafford has been given the nod in the first two games, he was fantastic for Burnley last season.

'Guehi deal hangs in the balance',"Sky Sports News' Rob Dorsett: With about half an hour to go before the deadline, Marc Guehi's move to Liverpool hangs in the balance. Sky Sports News has been told by two separate sources that Palace will not cancel the deal at this late stage. The Palace captain has undergone a medical with Liverpool and a deal is in place. There has been no indication to Liverpool that the deal is in doubt. But Palace are yet to bring in a replacement and as things stand appear no closer to doing so. The message from Selhurst Park has consistently been that they would need to bring in a suitable successor for Guehi to go. Palace chairman Steven Parish has gone on record to say Palace may have to sell Guehi if he doesn't sign a contract as he has entered the final year of his deal. Oliver Glasner has said on numerous times over the past week that Guehi is irreplaceable at this late stage of the window and that he has to stay. Palace could in theory still cash in on Guehi in the winter transfer window, but it is unlikely they would be able to generate the £35m fee Liverpool have committed to. If Guehi is sold without an adequate replacement they risk leaving their head coach short ahead of their first season in Europe.",01/09/2025

'Guehi move still possible; But Gomez staying put',"Sky Sports News' Vinny O'Connor at the Liverpool training ground: ""This one has been full of twists as well. What I know is that Liverpool and Crystal Palace have agreed a £35million deal, and Guehi has been given the green light to have his medical. That medical is happening down in London, which Liverpool planned in advance to make sure there were no timing issues with the 7pm deadline. ""The sticking point has been Crystal Palace needing a replacement before they let him go. They thought they had that lined up with Igor Julio, but that deal collapsed. Even so, Palace haven’t told Guehi to abandon the medical or head back, so as far as I can tell, there’s still a very real chance this transfer goes through. ""Meanwhile, Joe Gomez is staying put. AC Milan were interested, and Palace had looked at him as a potential option, but there simply wasn’t enough time to get a deal done. So Gomez remains a Liverpool player, and the focus now is on getting Guehi’s signing completed.

'Wissa completes medical and expected to be handed Newcastle No 9 shirt',"Latest from Sky Sports News' Keith Downie: ""Brentford striker Yoane Wissa has completed his medical ahead of a £50 million transfer to Newcastle United, with a further £5 million agreed in potential add-ons. The forward was briefly spotted at a private hospital in Newcastle earlier today, where he underwent scans and a medical to finalise the deal. ""Wissa made the journey from London to Tyneside overnight, eager to see the transfer pushed through after protracted negotiations between the two clubs. Brentford had previously rejected two lower bids from Newcastle, the first of £25 million, before finally accepting this latest offer, more than double their initial valuation. ""For Newcastle, it represents a significant investment and a clear statement of intent. Having secured the £69 million signing of Nick Woltemade late last week, the Magpies were keen to add a player with proven Premier League experience to bolster their attack. Wissa, who has established himself as a consistent performer in England’s top flight, fits that profile perfectly. ""The drawn-out nature of the deal has mirrored the lengthy saga that saw Alexander Isak leave Newcastle earlier in the summer, a move that required patience from all parties. Now, Newcastle have their man, with only the final confirmation from the club left to make the transfer official. ""Wissa is expected to inherit the vacant No 9 shirt, following the departures of both Isak and Callum Wilson earlier this summer. The combined fees for their replacements, Woltemade and Wissa, amount to the exact sum Liverpool paid Newcastle for Isak, underlining the club’s strategic reinvestment in their attacking options.""",01/09/2025

Isak will sign a six-year contract here at Liverpool. “He is back in the building as well. He arrived this morning, started his medical here, spent a few hours off site. He left the training ground at 1:15pm but returned around about an hour ago as well. “Isak is doing the usual in-house media commitments, interviews, photographs etc and there'll be an unveiling video I'm sure at some point as well. “What we're awaiting for is the official announcement, the official confirmation of course from Liverpool but the fact that they've been able to get in another attacking option has enabled progression to be made in terms of Harvey Elliott's career and that move to Aston Villa. “We await the official announcement that Isak is indeed a Liverpool player now. Eyes peeled for that.”",01/09/2025

Why are Liverpool able to spend so much this summer?,"Former Aston Villa chief executive Christian Purslow: ""It’s absolutely fascinating. For most of their [the Fenway Sports Group] time in charge, which is now over 15 years, they’ve run a balanced transfer budget – outs paying for ins. ""They’ve done it successfully and have been competitive. ""But it’s fair to say we’re seeing a complete change of strategic approach from Fenway now. They’re making massive net investment and I think the question is why? ""My suspicion is two things. They’re looking at the competitive position for the first time in many years and they see a genuine opportunity to really dominate British and European football in a way that perhaps hasn’t been true over the last few years. ""The second element is the financial rules. These are heaven-made for a club like Liverpool. ""They have the most superb sponsorship revenue in football – there are household brands around the edge of the pitch every week, massive levels of commercial turnover. ""They redeveloped Anfield very successfully, it’s packed every week, so their revenues are high and the rules favour clubs like that. ""I think they’re sensing the financial rules may be changing. We’re starting to hear for the first time fans question if the rules are right, and it’s stopping big clubs from spending money, like Newcastle and Aston Villa. ""My sense is Liverpool are making hay while the sun shines, loading up on talent to put themselves in a position where they’re virtually impregnable. ""It’s brilliant strategic management, terrifying from a football point of view because adding Isak and Guehi to that team makes them nailed-on favourites and other clubs should be fearful and respectful of how they’re running their club.""",01/09/2025

'Isak move will only work if chemistry is right',"Analysis from Sky Sports' Paul Merson: ""I like him [Alexander Isak]. He’s a good player, but I don’t think it’s all over just because he’s signed. I don’t see it like that. The problem is Liverpool haven’t played well, yet they’ve beaten Newcastle and Arsenal. That’s the issue: they’ve not been at their best, but they’ve still got those results. ""It all depends on whether it works. You can have the best players in the world, but if it doesn’t gel, you don’t have the chemistry. When Liverpool were at their best, it was Mane, Salah and Firmino. Firmino would drop off, Salah would make those runs in, and Mane too, there was chemistry. ""For me, Firmino wasn’t a £125m player, but he made it all tick. Unless this new set-up gels, time will tell. What Slot has now is a lot of head-scratching, because he’s got big decisions to make with very good players.""",01/09/2025
Decisions loom for Slot,"Analysis from Sky Sports' Paul Merson: ""The problem now is Slot’s got decisions to make. If Ekitike comes in, Gakpo won’t play. If Gakpo goes out to the left, then Ekitike won’t play. He’s got a few problems coming up. ""For me, Szoboszlai plays. I know he’s filled in at right-back, but he’ll have to come back into midfield. Did they win the league last year because their midfield was outstanding with Gravenberch, Mac Allister and Szoboszlai? ""All of a sudden, Wirtz is in there, a £100m player, and at the moment it isn’t working. So he’s got a lot of decisions to make. I just think, why don’t they sort it for early doors instead of waiting until the last minute? It’s ridiculous really.""",01/09/2025

To that end, the Brighton defender Igor Julio is currently undergoing a medical before sealing a move to Selhurst Park - although the Eagles have concerns that West Ham may make a late move to try to persuade Igor to join them.

"Donnarumma In, Ederson Out?","Analysis from Sky Sports News' Sanny Rudravajhala: ""Well, what a move this would be for Manchester City. On the surface, bringing in one of the best goalkeepers in the world would be a boost for any club. ""At City, though, it raises several questions. We understand it would allow Ederson to move on, with Fenerbahçe emerging as a strong possibility. But what would this mean for James Trafford? ""Learning from Donnarumma would benefit any goalkeeper. At just 26, the Italian already has a decade of first-team experience, and still has many years ahead of him. ""Trafford, who returned to City for £31m in the summer, could make his England debut during the international break. However, he has endured a mixed start, with costly mistakes in the defeat to Spurs and in the loss at Brighton on Sunday. ""Ederson, now in his ninth season at the club, looks likely to leave. But how would Donnarumma fit into Pep Guardiola’s system? We saw with Joe Hart’s replacement by Claudio Bravo that Guardiola prefers ball-playing goalkeepers. Donnarumma doesn’t quite fit that mould. He has also faced criticism for struggling with crosses and set pieces. On those fronts, could Trafford be the better option? Still, it would be hard for City to turn down the chance to sign a Champions League winner, no matter what the repercussions might be.""",01/09/2025

Gomez to AC Milan riding on potential Guehi deal,"Exclusive from Sky Sports News' Rob Dorsett and Vinny O'Connor: Liverpool have received an offer from AC Milan for Joe Gomez in what would be a substantive move to Serie A - but it now looks unlikely the deal can be completed in time for tonight’s 7pm deadline. Liverpool will categorically not allow Gomez to leave, unless they have Marc Guehi or another top level centre back in. Arne Slot is keen to to have BOTH Guehi and Gomez in his ranks once the deadline passes. Milan’s owners, Red Bird Capital, also have a stake in Fenway Sports Group, who own Liverpool, and the two sides talked late into last night before thrashing out terms on Gomez moving to Italy. Separately, we are told Milan held talks with Gomez’s representatives and were close to agreeing a deal before the plug was pulled. The deal was entirely dependent on Liverpool completing a deal for Guehi to move to Anfield from Crystal Palace - and whilst that transfer is still active, both sides feel there isn’t enough time to complete the necessary logistics to do the Gomez move after Guehi. Gomez was poised to fly to Italy, but Liverpool haven’t given him permission to do so.",01/09/2025

Neville: Goalkeeper a priority for United,"Speaking on his Sky Sports podcast, Gary Neville says Man Utd need to sign a new goalkeeper. United are linked with a deadline day move for Aston Villa's Emi Martinez, as well as Royal Antwerp’s Senne Lammens. ""It's just really clear that Manchester United need to bring a goalkeeper in,"" said Neville. ""They weren't brilliant yesterday night but I thought they should have been 2-0 or 3-0 up at half time. They missed some big chances. I thought they were far better than Burnley. ""But you know going in at 1-0 that Burnley are going to come and have a period and obviously then you end up with a nervy second half because there's just an anxiousness around United at this moment in time and you know late on it was a big relief. ""But a much-needed win doesn't clear the clouds completely. I think they'll come back in a couple of weeks, there are big games against City and against Chelsea coming up in the Premier League. ""[Saturday] was a good moment for [Ruben Amorim] in the end but it's bloody hard work winning football matches like that and if your goalkeeper is making mistakes it undermines everything that you do. ""That ground is the most unforgiving for goalkeepers. The fans get behind managers, the fans get behind all the players but I've said it before about the Manchester United goalkeeper spot and I'll say it again: the toughest position in English football bar none. ""If you give goals away at United and you're a goalkeeper you'll get scrutinized heavily. Centre forward is just behind it. ""You have to have a goalkeeper that's got a massive personality and character and it's not about the fact that they won't make a mistake. A Manchester United goalkeeper, a Liverpool goalkeeper, any goalkeeper will make mistakes. It's how you make mistakes, how you recover from them, how you look in your body language and how you look authoritative. ""I have to say the two that they've got are not going to feel that so they have to get a goalkeeper in my mind I thought it for a number of months. Every United fan thinks it. ""The midfield is equally as big a problem by the way but I think that that's going to be too much of an ask but that's a big problem in midfield as well. There's holes in there like you wouldn't believe.""",31/08/2025

Newcastle target Wissa releases bombshell statement as he demands Brentford exit,"Newcastle target Yoane Wissa has released a bombshell statement in which he has accused Brentford of ""unduly standing in his way"" of a move and wants to leave the club before tomorrow's 7pm deadline. He said on Instagram: “I have stayed silent for much of the summer, but with just hours remaining of the transfer window I feel compelled make it clear that I want to leave Brentford. I believe the club are unduly standing in my way despite a series of fair offers throughout the summer. “Earlier this summer, I held open discussions with the club’s senior management, including key directors and the new head coach. I made clear my intention to explore a new challenge. “During these conversations, it was confirmed to me and my representatives that the club would not stand in my way if a reasonable offer was received. This was also put in writing. “Based on this understanding, I sought to find a new club, keeping Brentford informed with full transparency at every step. “I received a formal offer from another Premier League club and communicated I wanted to join. I was under the impression, from all my conversations with Brentford, that there was a mutual agreement to part ways. “Yet as the window comes to an end, the club has now significantly changed its position, going against what was communicated. This has left me in a difficult and frustrating position. The promise that I could leave this summer has not been fulfilled. It saddens me to have to write that, and I maintain total respect for the club and its fans. “I want to make it clear that I have not acted unprofessionally, nor do I wish to leave Brentford on bad terms. I have been transparent in my position throughout. I have continued to communicate openly with the club and conduct myself in a way that reflects my values as both a footballer and a human being. “I remain hopeful that a fair and reasonable resolution can still be found before the transfer window shuts. “In the meantime, I must do what I feel is right for my career and family and insist that Brentford honour their promise to let me join a new club and at a fair price. “Being made to stay beyond this summer will only tarnish four wonderful years at this incredible club and so I ask Brentford’s owners and directors to now honour their promise to let me leave in the final hours of the window.""",31/08/2025

Pereira wants two more signings,"Wolves supporters were left frustrated as their team succumbed to a third consecutive Premier League defeat as they were beaten 3-2 by Everton. During the second half, they made their feelings clear. “Back the team or sell the club,” they sang to the owners. Asked in the press conference about those chants and whether he feels backed, Vitor Pereira said: “They are trying to help the team. I hope until the end of the market they try to add at least two players to help us because we need more solutions. Especially in attack.” Pereira added that he also wants “solution in midfield because we need competition” and stressed that he empathised with the supporters. “I am suffering with them because, more than the result, I don’t see my team playing the way we are working.” The Wolves boss did suggest that striker Jorgen Strand Larsen would still be at the club at the conclusion of the transfer window, reiterating that the reason for his omission for his game was the result of an inflamed Achilles tendon suffered against Bournemouth.",30/08/2025

Sheehan: Ask Celtic about Idah,"Latest from Sky Sports' Anthony Joseph: Swansea City boss Alan Sheehan told reporters to “ask Celtic” what is going on with Adam Idah’s situation. Idah completed a medical and agreed personal terms ahead of a £7m move, but was called back by Celtic after they struggled to reach an agreement with Anderlecht for striker Kasper Dolberg by close of play yesterday. Talks are ongoing between Celtic and Anderlecht over Dolberg and there’s still a feeling Idah could join Swansea before Monday’s transfer deadline. Following their 2-0 win at Sheffield Wednesday today, Sheehan said: ""The latest is that he is not our player. He is currently a Glasgow Celtic player so right now I can only talk about Swansea players.

Jackson to return to Chelsea,"Latest from Sky Sports News' chief correspondent Kaveh Solhekol: Nicolas Jackson has to come back to Chelsea. Nothing was signed with Bayern Munich and there is no paperwork. He was given permission to travel and have a medical and that permission has been revoked. Chelsea have a good working relationship with Bayern – this situation may have been different if this was a permanent deal but Bayern insisted on a loan. This is a unique and awkward situation but the expectation is that everyone is going to act professionally. If this was a permanent deal, Chelsea would be able to use the fee received to buy another forward – but it is not, and in any case, there are very strikers available in the market at the moment. Bayern could try to change the deal to a permanent move, but time is running out and potential replacements are scarce. Bayern have made it clear they are only in the market for loans. It’s understandable the player is disappointed – he was hoping to become the heir to Harry Kane, but he is a Chelsea player and is contracted until 2033. Bayern have been informed that Chelsea have no intention of loaning the player and he has been asked to return. The permission to have a medical has been revoked. Meanwhile, Chelsea are waiting for a response from Barcelona about their €40m bid for Fermin Lopez.",30/08/2025
"Howe looking forward to 'clarity' on squad, but says group is stronger","Eddie Howe says he is looking forward to 'clarity' on what his squad looks like ahead of the transfer deadline, but adds is group is stronger than at this time last year. There has been plenty of speculation around his team that remains unresolved, especially on the future of Alexander Isak. Howe said he was not party to the talks on the striker so did not know how the situation would pan out. Speaking about the deadline, Howe told Sky Sports: ""We're really looking forward to that clarity in terms of what our squad looks like. ""Once we have that, we'll move forward and I'm sure we can do really well this year."" When asked if he was hoping for new arrivals, Howe added: ""I'm not sure on that really. Being the manager, you're always hopeful. ""You think that you can add maybe one more that can make a difference, but there's no guarantees on that. We'll keep working to the end of the window. ""We're really pleased with what we've done so far. I genuinely feel we're a lot stronger squad-wise than we were last year. ""We've had an issue at the top end of the pitch [at the start of this season] so fingers crossed we might be able to do some more."" Newcastle announced new signing Nick Woltemade before Saturday's draw at Leeds, and Howe gave an insight into his striker. ""He's a really good technician. His size will be a talking point because he's obviously a big presence, but he's not really a target man, although he can head the ball. ""It's his creativity around the box. It's his link play. He dribbles with the ball really well for someone so big and he's got real creativity around the box. He will find passes that not many other players can see. ""He can add a dimension that we currently don't have and it will lift confidence because when you feel you have goalscorers in your team,  the general level of your whole squad goes up. ""You've got to have lots of strings to your bow to be successful in England and he has them. I'm really looking forward to seeing him play in our team.""",30/08/2025

Chelsea sign Garnacho from Man Utd,"Chelsea have signed winger Alejandro Garnacho in a £40m transfer from Manchester United. They have now spent nearly £300m on nine new arrivals this summer - but have a positive net spend as things stand after recouping more than £314m in sales. Garnacho, 21, has signed a long-term deal at Chelsea and says he is happy to be joining ""the best team in the world"". Sky Sports A compromise over Garnacho's valuation had to be reached as United valued him at £50m, which was more than Chelsea were prepared to pay. United negotiated the fee up from an initial Chelsea offer of £25m and are understood to feel it is a good, pragmatic deal, delivering their largest sale fee for five years. They also believe it is a good solution for the player, who has been pushing strongly to leave. The deal, which includes a 10 per cent sell-on fee, represents the fourth-largest sale in United's history after those of Cristiano Ronaldo, Romelu Lukaku and Angel Di Maria - and the club's largest sale of an academy graduate.",30/08/2025
Liverpool make £35m bid for Guehi,"Latest from Sky Sports News' Mark McAdam, Kaveh Solhekol, Lyall Thomas and Rob Dorsett: Liverpool have made a £35m offer for Crystal Palace defender Marc Guehi. The bid is currently being considered by Palace, who value Guehi at £40 million. Palace would be willing to accept a deal of £35m plus £5m in add ons, but Liverpool have currently offered a 10% sell on clause as well as the initial fee. However, the south London club do not want to sell the defender until they have a replacement. Sky Sports News understands Liverpool's Joe Gomez has become a part of discussions between the clubs. Palace have an interest in Gomez - and it would be a separate deal - but how keen he is on the move to Selhurst Park at this stage is unknown. Liverpool would not allow Gomez to leave on loan and they are also reluctant to sell a player who offers so much versatility in their backline. Gomez is also on the lists at AC Milan and Tottenham, although Thomas Frank has appeared to cool his interest in signing a new centre-back. Milan appear to be prioritising Manchester City's Manuel Akanji at the moment - another player of interest to Palace and on Spurs' radar. Guehi's future could go right to the wire with Deadline Day approaching on September 1. Palace boss Oliver Glasner has pleaded for the player to stay at the club until his contract expires next summer. Palace could sign more than one new centre-back. Separately from the Guehi situation, they are progressing with a £22.5m deal for Toulouse's 19-year-old Jaydee Canvot.",30/08/2025

Selles’ nightmare start to life in charge of United continued as they went down 1-0 at Middlesbrough, leaving the Blades rock bottom and without a point going into the first international break. Selles said: “I cannot control the situation. I will expect to go to my house tonight and then tomorrow go to work and then continue as normal. It’s not in my hands to make a decision. “And until the very last moment, I will just do my best and try to do my things. When the situation is not in my control, I don’t think too much about what is going to happen in the future. Because realistically, I do as much as I can. “At least if I go out, whether that’s tomorrow or if it’s in three years, I will always go out with the feeling that I made the decisions that I want to make. Obviously that includes my mistakes, but my decisions were honest and what I thought was the correct thing to do in every single moment.” Selles, who previously managed Reading during the Royals’ off-the-field struggles and transfer embargoes, added: “I have been in worse situations and I end up just making the things happen and changing totally around the dynamics. “So I don’t have a doubt about it. I’ve been in situations where I haven’t been paid on time, situations when they get points deductions, situations where we didn’t know if we would be able to train the next day at the training ground. “And the reality is that we turned things around at the moment of connection. But you need to work hard to go to that moment and you need to go through a couple of critical moments on that journey.”",30/08/2025

Newcastle open door for Liverpool Isak bid,"Latest from Sky Sports News' Keith Downie: Newcastle have opened the door for Liverpool to make a British-record bid for Alexander Isak. The potential signing of Nick Woltemade - who is arriving on Tyneside on Thursday night - increases the likelihood of Isak leaving for Liverpool with less than four days left of the transfer window.

However, Newcastle will attempt to bring in a second striker before listening to offers from Liverpool. They are trying to sign Yoane Wissa from Brentford. Liverpool had a £110m plus add-ons bid rejected for Isak earlier in the summer so will have to increase their offer to reach an agreement with Newcastle.

""I could have seen him go in at Chelsea with Malo Gusto, Reece James - attacking wing-backs who can make things happen and cross the ball. They're up and down. Chelsea have three centre-backs who would have suited the way he played. ""They got the wrong man for the players they had. He had changed the whole lot. They're not going to do that and he's not going to change his system for Man Utd. ""He came in from Portugal to one of the biggest jobs in world football playing the way he played. Why would he change? ""He didn't want to come in during the middle of the season because he knew they were not his players. No wing-backs. Then he had to come in, it was a mad struggle and this season he hasn't got it. ""He has probably just gone: I just have to outscore teams. With Mbeumo, Cunha and Sesko up front. Fernandes playing as well. And I don't think he'll do that. ""Everybody went mad after the Arsenal game. Why? They lost. Last season they drew 1-1 with them and should have won that game.

If Man Utd turn up with the attitude Grimsby had, there's only one result and everyone would have been turning over at half-time, looking for something else to watch. That wasn't the case. ""Half of them turned up thinking: 'I'm only playing because it's Grimsby. I won't be playing against Burnley on Saturday'. Instead of: 'When I walk off that game, those Grimsby fans and players will go: I didn't know he was that good.' That's not the case. ""Their attitude stinks from half of them. Back in the day, there were shocks, the pitches were a joke. That pitch was immaculate and they should go out and destroy Grimsby. ""Cristiano Ronaldo doesn't' get to the top by just his talent.

The Toffees manager said: ""We wanted to try and give as many players (as possible) a game. I've not got any defenders. I'm very limited to what I can choose defensive-wise. ""It already has changed a lot of my plans because, obviously, we're without Jarrad and we have been without Myko for, certainly, the first couple of games. ""We had this at the end of last season as well, we've had it all through the summer. It's not as if we've necessarily got it better. ""We've got people back, but others are injured. We've just got to make sure that we're not short again if we can help it - and certainly we were short for the first two games in the Premier League.""",28/08/2025

Should Wolves sell Strand Larsen?,"Sky Sports News' Rob Dorsett: ""A Premier League-ready replacement. That's the point. ""Jorgen Strand Larsen is a key part of the Wolves side, he's such an important player for them. ""They can't just buy a young player or take a risk on somebody from a European club who doesn't know the Premier League, and just throw him in there and expect him to do a job. It would leave a big hole in the Wolves squad. ""For Wolves to accept an offer for him at this stage, it has to be a big bid. And the big question is: is this new £60m bid - when it goes in - big enough to persuade them to sell? ""It would be a good level of profit of them. he was on loan at Celta Vigo last season and there was an obligation to buy him for £23m. They've just spent £23m on him and they could then sell him for £60m. ""That sounds like a good bit of business - until you start thinking about where they are going to get a replacement from.""",27/08/2025

Brentford considering move for Dormund's Beier,"Exclusive from Sky Sports News' Lyall Thomas and Dharmesh Sheth: Brentford are considering a move for Borussia Dortmund forward Max Beier. There has been no approach to Dortmund yet and he is one of several front players Brentford are looking at. Beier is someone of long-term interest to the club and they tried to sign him last summer. He signed for Dortmund instead and made 46 appearances, most of which were off the bench. He was also left on the bench for their opening Bundesliga game against St Pauli. Dortmund are getting closer to an agreement with Wolves for striker Fabio Silva and if they sign him, it may limit Beier’s game time further. Brentford are in the market for someone who plays predominantly off the left-hand side to potentially replace Newcastle target Yoane Wissa. They want a replacement secured before letting Wissa go. Beier can play anywhere across the front line but has mostly been a centre-forward at Dortmund.",26/08/2025

At the minute, there are still too many people uncertain or still trying to think, 'maybe there's something there for me'. The window needs to shut quickly. ""In-house, we need to make sure that we have people who really want to be here, so the people that come in and the people that stay really want to be here. We'll see.""

Gordon offers apology for red card vs Liverpool,"Newcastle forward Anthony Gordon has taken to social media to apologise for being sent off during his side's defeat to Liverpool. The England international was shown a red card for a challenge on Liverpool captain Virgil van Dijk on the brink of half-time. Gordon was initially shown a yellow before VAR recommended an on-field review, by which it was overturned by referee Simon Hooper. Newcastle were behind at the time of the sending off but managed to fight back after conceding again shortly after the break and make it 2-2 despite being a man down. However, substitute Rio Ngumoha scored a late dagger to stun Newcastle. In a message posted on Instagram, Gordon said: ""I want to sincerely apologise to my team-mates and the fans. My intentions were pure. I was just trying to create energy in the game and I mistimed the tackle. ""I would never intend to tackle somebody like this on purpose. We spoke after and he [Van Dijk] knows that. ""More importantly, I'm so proud of the time I spent on the pitch and how we played tonight. The atmosphere is what makes St James Park so special. ""I love everything we stand for as a club, no more than right now. I'll be back and better, the same as every other setback I have faced.""",26/08/2025

Spurs' Paz chase hits Real snag,"Latest from Sky Sports' Lyall Thomas and Michael Bridge: Tottenham look increasingly unlikely to sign Como’s Nico Paz. The Argentina international has been among several of interest for a new No.10. But Real Madrid – his former club – still have financial interests in the player that make any deal extremely complicated. Real have incremental buy-back clauses beginning at £8.6m (€10m) this summer, and increasing for summer 2026 and 2027, as well as a 50 per cent sell-on clause. It means Real Madrid essentially have the final say on any Spurs offer and, even if it was agreed, would take half the fee due to Como. According to Sky in Italy, Como want almost £61m (€70m) guaranteed plus add-ons on top. Sky in Italy have reported Spurs have been willing to pay upwards of £56m guaranteed plus around £8.7m in add-ons.

Asked if Wissa would be able to be reintegrated into the squad if he does not leave west London, Andrews added: ""That's the plan. If I didn't think it would be, my stance on it would probably be different. ""We've got a phenomenal group of players and staff that has been built over numerous years, where there's a real culture of togetherness, a real underpinning of respect throughout the building. ""People walk in and they feel that. Anybody that's not attached to the football club can sense the club is run in a certain way.""",25/08/2025

Man City want to keep Ederson - but have Donnarumma's name in mind,"Latest from Sky Sports' Lyall Thomas, Dharmesh Sheth, Amar Mehta and Kaveh Solhekol: Manchester City’s intention remains to keep Ederson and James Trafford as their goalkeepers beyond the deadline.

Prime among those is PSG’s Gianluigi Donnarumma and there is understood to have been initial contact between the clubs.

Contrary to reports, City have not agreed personal terms with the player's representatives. Donnarumma waved goodbye to the PSG fans on Friday night as he was left out of the squad for their Ligue 1 win over Angers.

Slot hints Liverpool may not need Isak,"Liverpool head coach Arne Slot has hinted his team does not need another forward this summer - as the club continue their pursuit of Alexander Isak. The Reds have seen a lot of change in their forward line with Darwin Nunez and Luis Diaz leaving the club - as well as the tragic passing of Diogo Jota. The club have recruited Hugo Ekitike in the centre forward area but Slot still believes they have two players for each forward position. “It depends how you want to look at it,” said Slot. “If you see Florian Wirtz as an attacking option as well, you can make it five [forwards available]. “Yes we’ve sold Darwin, we’ve brought in Hugo, Luis is gone, but maybe you can see Florian as his replacement. Then you have Jeremie Frimpong who, when he is fit, is definitely an option to play as a winger as well. So then we end up at six. We have six players who can play in three positions. “I would consider Florian in more games for that position. There were games last season – [Manchester] City away and Villa away – where we did play with an extra midfielder, I think Curtis Jones. It depends not only on being an extra midfielder, but also the tactics and how the opposition line up.”",24/08/2025

Howe: Newcastle won't be left without a striker this season,"Eddie Howe is confident that Newcastle will not leave him without a recognised striker as the Alexander Isak situation rumbles on.

Isak was the subject of a £110m bid from Liverpool and has not featured for Howe's first-team in a match since the Magpies players returned from pre-season. Howe was asked if there is a situation where Isak is sold and Newcastle do not bring a replacement in. “I don’t think the club will allow that situation to happen,”  said Howe. “We certainly can’t go through the season with no recognised striker at the football club – and that’s no disrespect to Will Osula. “I think he’s doing really well and he’s progressing really well, but he’s got limited experience in the Premier League, although I’m really happy with his career progression. “But Alex at the moment would be the only striker we have with Premier League history of goals and appearances and starts, so we can’t leave ourselves in that position.”",24/08/2025

""I know that there's a lot of talk at Fulham about the fact they've not made signings and there's a little bit of despair. When a club doesn't make signings everyone feels a little bit sort of downbeat about it. ""But I looked at the Fulham team and I saw the Fulham bench, I thought: Fulham are okay, Fulham have got a good team already, they've got a good bench. ""Liverpool famously didn't really add too much to their team last year and won the title and sometimes not adding players can be as good as adding players because you can sort of freshen it up for no apparent reason. ""From what I saw today of Fulham, the team that started did well and the four or five that came on did really well and they actually made them a lot better. ""You think of sort of Raúl Jiménez coming off the bench, Emile Smith Rowe, Antonee Robinson, Harry Wilson, they were really bright and they were too sharp for United in that last period of the game. ""So maybe one or two coming in this week would add a little bit of a spark that naturally a new signing does, but don't be too disheartened Fulham fans about it. ""The team that I saw consistently do well last season, I think will do well this season. The fact that you've come back in two games, you've shown a spirit, you've played well, I think it was a good performance from Fulham in the end.

Nuno reveals how many more signings Forest need,"Nuno Espirito Santo has revealed what he wants from Nottingham Forest in the final days of the transfer window: two new full-backs and a goalkeeper. Amid multiple outbursts of frustration about Forest's window so far, Nuno guided his side to a 1-1 draw against Crystal Palace on Sunday. During the match, Forest were able to call on a quartet of new signings from the substitutes' bench including James McAtee, Arnaud Kalimuendo, Igor Jesus and Omari Hutchinson - with Douglas Luiz unused. ""That’s basic for us,"" said Nuno about having those options from the bench. ""Honestly, I say again that we need some more options, especially in the full-back [position] because we are always afraid if something happens to Ola [Aina] and Neco [Williams]. What are we going to do? Are we going to put a centre-half there? ""So I hope this week we can complete the squad, and next a goalkeeper – to really be safe. ""Now we have good options and talented players and now we are trying to assess them. We finished almost with [solely] new players, but the flow is still not there. And with work and their belief, I think it can work out. ""These three bodies that we need – one goalkeeper and two full-backs – in terms of numbers we will then be at 23 or 24 players. That’s what I think gives us the right balance to face what we have. ""Now it’s only Premier League but in a quick turnaround we’re going to play Europe and cups. We need players.""",24/08/2025

Wissa has previously been reportedly ""furious"" after believing he was given assurances he would be allowed to leave this summer after Ivan Toney's departure last summer. ""It's not the right thing to do to involve him in the squad,"" Andrews told Sky Sports. ""The team is always the priority in everything we do. ""There has to be a focus on getting a result today, and I felt it was the right thing to do to get involve Yoane.""",23/08/2025

But then it is about him staying as fit as he is at the moment. “He is in a much better place now and as we can all see when we needed a goal and I looked at the bench I only had him and Rio (Ngumoha), a 16-year-old, as attacking options. “For me, although Rio did really well in pre-season it was quite a normal choice to bring him in and he delivered.”",23/08/2025

A £67.5m deal was agreed with Arsenal, with the 27-year-old playmaker now edging closer to completing his move to the Emirates.

It was a challenge to make moves for players until the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) confirmed 11 days ago that they would be playing in the Conference League.

EXCLUSIVE: Nuno comments baffle Marinakis and throw Forest future into doubt,"Latest from Sky Sports News' Rob Dorsett: Sky Sports News has been told co-owner Evangelos Marinakis and the Nottingham Forest bosses are baffled by Nuno Espirito Santo’s latest comments, and there has been no intention of sacking him as the club’s manager. However, Nuno’s comments today, saying his relationship with the Forest owner is ""not the same...it is not so good as it was (last season)” has caused some within the club to seriously question his commitment to the job. There is growing speculation elsewhere that he may now be trying to manufacture a situation where he is sacked. There is now a real possibility Nuno may not be in charge for Sunday’s game against Crystal Palace. There is also understood to be anger that the manager has spoken out like this, two days before a crucial and emotive game against Crystal Palace, who missed out on the Europa League while Forest progressed. Today’s comments from the Forest boss come a week after he said in an exclusive interview with Sky Sports ahead of the opening game that his squad was “unbalanced” and “very, very far” from being ready for the new season. Since Nuno said that, Marinakis has sanctioned over £118m worth of spending on four new players in the last week. That level of spending, the Greek billionaire feels, is proof that the manager still had his full confidence and backing. The root of Nuno’s upset is not wholly understood, however it’s thought he has a difficult relationship with Forest’s new global head of football, Edu, who was appointed last month to oversee the recruitment strategy for Forest and the other clubs in Marinakis’ multi-club empire - Olympiakos in Greece and Rio Ave in Portugal. Nevertheless, despite Edu’s arrival, the club structure at the City Ground and Nuno’s role have not changed since he took over in December 2023. While he has had a say in transfer strategy and the players being targeted, his role has been to galvanise and organise that group of players as the head coach in charge of the first team.

Fulham would be an attractive option as would the chance to work with head coach Marco Silva.

Moyes: We have money to spend on players - but no European football hindering us,"Everton manager David Moyes has money available for this transfer window but is struggling to spend it as the lack of European football is proving a barrier. So far the club have spent £75m on six players, and while the loan signing of Manchester City winger Jack Grealish is by far the most high-profile, Moyes is finding it tough to bolster a squad which saw seven first-teamers depart in the summer. “We have money to spend and we are trying to spend it,” he said of Everton's first competitive match in their new Hill Dickinson Stadium. “It is not we don’t have the money to spend, we do have, but we’re finding it very difficult to spend the money at the moment. “We’ve really gone for some top players but unfortunately we’ve not been able to get them, so we might be finding ourselves coming down the ladder to find players because we are short on numbers generally. We are going to have to adjust.” Asked what was preventing Everton securing a lot of their targets, Moyes added: “Absolutely Europe. If you have European football you attract a a different level of player, you are more attractive. “We have got to build an awful lot of trust with players and maybe agents to show we are a club moving in the right direction. “I think our ownership have come in and helped us and they will give us a chance to spend more money but I believe the better players want European football, most of them or a lot of them do.”",22/08/2025

Lammens was signed two years ago from Club Brugge and any sale would represent nearly 100 per cent profit for the Belgian club.

"Hurzeler hopeful of transfer activity, but happy with forward options","Fabian Hurzeler is hopeful Brighton will still be active during the rest of the transfer window, but is content with his forward options before Sunday’s trip to Everton. Big-money signing Charalampos Kostoulas sat out the 1-1 draw with Fulham as he adapts to a new country and league. It is a similar story for Stefanos Tzimas, which resulted in Georginio Rutter being deployed up front on Saturday until he was replaced by Danny Welbeck. The same duo are likely to be required at Everton as 18-year-old Kostoulas is handled with care, but Hurzeler is not pushing chairman Tony Bloom for new additions. “I’m not knocking on his door otherwise I would always have to travel to London. I’m happy living here in Brighton,” Hurzeler told a press conference with a smile. “We are in talks every day so we know our thoughts, we know both opinions. Let’s see what happens. “There are always opportunities in football, so never say never in football. “Of course with the loss of Joao (Pedro), we miss one more striker. Stefanos needs time to get up to speed, so it’s a little bit of a balance thing. You have two strikers with Danny and with Georgi, like how to finish a game, how to start a game, how to finish strong. “For example, if Georgi starts, you can replace him with Danny. If you start with both, then you need to think about who’s the replacement. It’s more a balance thing, but I’m very happy Georgi can play both positions.”",22/08/2025

Celtic eye winger and striker reinforcements,"Latest from Sky Sports News' Anthony Joseph: Celtic are pursuing a deal for Royal Antwerp winger Michel-Ange Balikwisha. Sky Sports News understands a fee in the region of £5m will be enough to secure the 24-year-old. The Hoops are yet to replace striker Kyogo Furuhashi, who was sold to Rennes for £10m in January and has subsequently moved to Birmingham City. They have signed Callum Osmand and Shin Yamada, but both appear to be project signings. While the club are looking to sign another striker, if they can bring in two new wingers, it would allow Daizen Maeda to play as the No 9 with Adam Idah, Yamada and Johnny Kenny as back-up. Celtic may have brought in club legend Kierney Tierney as their first-choice left-back – but they need cover. Greg Taylor left Glasgow for Greece last month, when he joined PAOK after his contract expired. Tierney is unlikely to be able to play all fixtures this season, so the Hoops are looking for someone to share the role with him. Celtic know it is not as easy to sell for a second-choice left-back, but whoever they bring in will get a sufficient amount of game time. At the moment, it looks like the Hoops are searching for a young player to fill that role and develop. But if they can’t secure that, they may have to go with a more experienced option, or a loan.",21/08/2025
"Celtic targeting wingers, striker and a left-back - targets identified","Latest from Sky Sports News' Anthony Joseph: Celtic are in the market for two wingers, a striker and a left-back before the September 1 deadline, with a number of enquiries made on top targets. They may also be forced into the market for a right-back depending on the severity of Alistair Johnston’s hamstring injury, which he picked up last night. The Canada international had scans today and is awaiting the results. Many of the top-level targets that Rodgers and the recruitment team want in are waiting to see if Celtic make the Champions League before making a decision. Celtic need a winger to replace Nicolas Kuhn, who left for Como for £16.5m this summer – and also provide cover for Jota, who is out injured until January. Feyenoord winger Calvin Stengs fits that bill. The Scottish champions have made an enquiry for the Netherlands international but are unlikely to make a move unless they secure Champions League football, as it would require a sizeable fee and big wages to sign him. Sky Sports News understands the Hoops are still in the race for Go Ahead Eagles attacking midfielder Jakob Breum. Fresh talks have been held today for the Denmark U21 international. It’s understood the Eredivisie club are looking for at least £5m for Breum. Celtic have already had two bids rejected – the latest offer being £2.6m last month. The 21-year-old, who can also play on both wings, has two years left on his contract.",21/08/2025

Parkinson: Doyle signing is a 'statement of intent',"Wrexham boss Phil Parkinson believes the eye-catching acquisition of Manchester City defender Callum Doyle is a ""statement of intent"" from the ambitious Championship new boys. Wrexham have paid an initial fee of £5m for the England U21 international, with £3m in add-ons. Sky Sports News City have a buyback clause of £7.5m for Doyle and also inserted a 25 per cent sell-on clause into the deal. The Red Dragons have been busy this summer as Ryan Reynolds and Rob Mac's men rebuild for their first season back in English football's second tier since the 1981-82 campaign. Doyle is Wrexham's 10th permanent signing since promotion and follows last week's club-record £10m purchase of Nathan Broadhead from Ipswich. ""Callum's a player we've obviously been looking at over the summer,"" Wrexham boss Parkinson said. ""Always difficult deals to get because there's a player in demand. We've had to compete with some really good clubs to bring him here. ""He's only 21, he's got a lot of Championship experience, an England Under-21 international. I think he's a player of huge potential. ""This hasn't broken the transfer record. It's in line with other transfers we've made already this summer. ""But I think it is a statement of intent that we've won the signature over some established Championship clubs, who've been in the division and Premiership before recently, and obviously clubs in other European leagues.""",21/08/2025

Merse: Selling Jackson is a mistake - he'll come back to haunt Chelsea,"Sky Sports' Paul Merson on The Premier League Show: ""I like Jackson, I've seen a lot of him. He's a bit messy and his touch will be poor - but I'd love to play with him. The position I played in, I'd love to have played with him because he opens games up. If I were Aston Villa or Newcastle, I'd buy them all day long. He goes the other way, and on a big pitch like Newcastle's you could get Bruno Guimaraes or Sandro Tonali more on the ball. ""If you asked a lot of defenders, I reckon after the game - even though he is messy and needs more coaching - I don't think there would be too many centre-halves who would say: that was easy. He gives you a hard time, he's willing to run. ""I'm pretty shocked with Chelsea. He made Cole Palmer and Palmer made Jackson. They worked as a pair and really stretched the game and it got Palmer on the ball and let him do his stuff. ""Now I don't see that. Joao Pedro  wants to come short and compresses Palmer's game. I know we're one game in, btu Palmer is going further and further back to get the ball. You don't want him there, you want him around the box as he can weave his magic as he is the X-Factor. ""I don't think this is a great move for Chelsea. I think it's a mistake. Jackson could come back to haunt them if he went to Newcastle of Villa, by scoring a few goals.""",21/08/2025

Merse: Pressure on Arsenal to win the league now,"Sky Sports' Paul Merson speaking on The Premier League Show: ""I don’t think he walks straight in and plays this weekend against Leeds, but when they put their best team out against Liverpool and Manchester City at home, he plays. He’s the X-Factor, the missing piece of Arsenal winning the Premier league. ""The pressure is now on to win the Premier League. Mikel Arteta has bought amazingly. They needed a holding midfielder, they bought a top-drawer one in Martin Zubimendi. They needed a centre forward, they bought a centre forward. Now they’ve bought someone who can break defences and who can get into a lot of teams. ""I watched Arsenal a lot, when the pressure is on they find it hard to break teams down. They rely on Martin Odegaard, when he doesn’t do it – and he didn’t do it last season – they struggle. Bukayo Saka got injured, he’s the other one they rely on. But Eze is different class. Sky Sports ""In my opinion, he’s a more significant signing than Viktor Gyokeres. With Eze in the team, he makes things happen. He’s not going to run around, the fans need to understand that. He’s like Mesut Ozil, who just glides around. He’s not going to track back 60 yards. But give him the ball, he will make things happen. ""These Arsenal players need to win the Premier League, the more top drawer players they get in at the top end of the field, the better they will be. When you play for your Arsenal, Chelseas, Liverpools and Man City, you kick off and they put 10 players behind the ball. You have to break them down. ""Eze just glides past people, he doesn’t even touch the ground sometimes. He wins free-kicks, he makes things happen. No disrespect to Palace where he was outstanding, he can play with even more top quality players now and go up a level. ""I’m so excited, I don’t get too excited for signings too often. I thought if Liverpool go and get Isak it would be another year of second for Arsenal, but they are right, right, right in it now.""",21/08/2025

Newcastle denied that any such commitment was made to the player in their statement responding to Isak’s post on Instagram. Legally, such an arrangement – if it did exist - is irrelevant to a player’s contract and in no way binding under Premier League rules.

Man Utd shut down summer interest in me - Maguire,"Harry Maguire says it would be “silly” to leave rebuilding Manchester United right now after revealing Ruben Amorim’s side shut down summer interest in him. United triggered a one-year extension in the 32-year-old's contract at the turn of the year and have rebuffed summer interest in the England international, who has yet to speak to the club about his future beyond this campaign. “Last year was the clause in their hands so there was no option for me there,” Maguire said. “There was no talking. It was just they activated it and it got extended. “This year, obviously I’m up at the end of the year. I’m pretty sure the club have made it aware this summer that I can’t leave the club on any terms with other clubs enquiring about my things and my position with my contract. “I’m sure over the next few months they’ll sit down, and we’ll have to have a conversation about where we want to go and if they want to extend or obviously the transfer window will open again in January. “Obviously I have something in my mind about what I want to do and what I want to be. “I don’t want to put it out there to everybody but it’s an amazing club to play for and you’d be silly if you wanted to jump out of it as soon as you could.” Asked whether United indicated this summer he was staying despite interest, Maguire added: “Yes. I think there was a couple of clubs who maybe enquired or spoke with them and I think they got a quick response. “We’re in a good place, positive as a club and I feel like the hierarchy has come in and Jason (Wilcox, director of football) and the manager, I feel like they’re taking it in the right direction.""",21/08/2025

Electric Eze will unlock defences for Arsenal,"Sky Sports' Peter Smith: Eberechi Eze is electric. The 27-year-old is a delight to watch with his poise and swagger on the ball and craft to open up defences, not to mention his penchant for scoring spectacular strikes himself. He finished last season as one of the hottest prospects in the country, scoring in six games in a row, including both the FA Cup semi-final and final at Wembley as he helped inspire Crystal Palace to their first ever major honour. Last season wasn’t all plain sailing, though. “I think Ebere has had a strange season,” said Palace boss Glasner at the end of March. “He hasn’t had many goals in the Premier League and he has been unlucky, but he keeps going. He’s also struggled with strange injuries.” Those comments came after Eze had ignited Palace in a FA Cup tie at Fulham, scoring one and setting up another. That standout display came on the back of a first goal for England. Fit and full of confidence, Eze was back to his best during the run-in. It is that livewire maverick Arsenal will hope can unlock deep defences and bring a spark to their previously at-times predictable patterns of attack. He offers something completely different to Leandro Trossard and Gabriel Martinelli, the current wide left options and Viktor Gyokeres will be relishing the prospect of latching onto the type of passes which have proved so productive for Jean-Philippe Mateta. After being released by the Gunners as a 13-year-old, Eze will be motivated to seize a second-chance in north London – and, in his prime, he looks set to do just that and make a big impact for Mikel Arteta.",21/08/2025

'Liverpool may step up Guehi interest if Palace win big in Europe',"Sky Sports News chief correspondent Kaveh Solhekol: ""It is possible [Marc Guehi leaves Crystal Palace in this window], it depends on what happens in the game tonight. If they win the game easily so that almost they're through the playoff, it doesn't matter about the return leg next week, I can see a situation where maybe Liverpool step up their interest in Guehi and make an increased bid for him in the next couple of days. ""And then Palace would have a decision to make. But having heard from [chairman] Steve Parish, he said we cannot have a situation where a player as good as Guehi leaves on a free transfer next summer. ""So they would possibly be open to selling both those players [Eberechi Eze as well]. But it's not all doom and gloom for Palace because Ebreche Eze will be replaced.

What can Bournemouth expect from Adli?,"Sky Sports' Adam Bate: The skilful Amine Adli looks a coup for Bournemouth given his involvement in Bayer Leverkusen’s domestic double under Xabi Alonso, a season in which he reached double figures for goals in all competitions. At the age of 25, he is coming into his peak years as a player. Capable of playing anywhere across the front line, the left-footed Adli has had most of his success playing from the left. He had a key role in Leverkusen’s cup success and sparked the comeback against Stuttgart that helped preserve their unbeaten Bundesliga run. Last season was more difficult for Adli as his minutes were restricted. Although he featured in 20 of their Bundesliga matches, only half a dozen of those appearances came from the start and he was on the pitch for less than a quarter of the campaign. Statistically, that makes him a tricky player to evaluate. He ranked among the top 25 players in the Bundesliga last season for passes completed in the final third, dribbles completed and possessions won in the final third – all of that based on per-90 data. Some analysts take the view that appearing as a regular substitute can favourably distort those numbers but essentially Adli has hinted that he can do the sort of things that Andoni Iraola demands at Bournemouth. Be creative and press high at pace. More of that will be expected of him in a Bournemouth shirt but crucially they are acquiring a player who has been a little frustrated at his lack of opportunities to impress. This could be a case of the right move at the right time for player and club.",21/08/2025

""Emotionally after the game you are exhausted and sometimes I shouted to my colleagues, it's just that there wasn't a camera. Marc was just disappointed that the goal was disallowed and we didn't win the game. ""I think it was reported in a negative way. I see it as completely the opposite.

Everton have had a number of bids rejected for Dibling and have so far been put off by Saints’ valuation in excess of £45m. But one source has indicated to Sky Sports News that another approach is anticipated.

Analysis: Huge focus on Gyokeres amid Havertz setback,"Sky Sports' Sam Blitz: Just days ago, the topic of debate was which striker out of Kai Havertz or Viktor Gyokeres should start in Arsenal's big game against Liverpool next week. ""I think Mikel Arteta will go back to Havertz in the big games,"" said Jamie Carragher. ""I would be very surprised if Havertz doesn't play."" Now it seems that decision has been taken out of Arteta's hands. No matter the severity of this Havertz knee injury, the German will be a major doubt for the trip to Anfield - placing a huge focus on Gyokeres in the first big game of his Arsenal career. But once again, Arsenal are talking about injuries after it derailed them last season. Havertz, Gabriel Jesus and Bukayo Saka all missed over a dozen league matches due to injury last term - only the latter is fully fit at the start of this one. Arsenal do know that Mikel Merino can fill in as an emergency option but that was an awkward scenario last season which Arteta and the Arsenal team made the most of. Playing the Spaniard as a No 9 again is a situation they are wanting to avoid, if possible. What this situation does tell us, though, is that Arsenal will have to get Gyokeres on song soon, after a slightly underwhelming Premier League debut at Manchester United last weekend. Saturday's game against Leeds - which Gyokeres will almost certainly start now - is important in the early context of Arsenal's season. Goals are needed. Sky Sports",20/08/2025
Liverpool have capacity to keep spending big,"Financial expert Kieran Maguire speaking on Sky Sports News' Transfer Talk: ""Part of the reason why Liverpool can afford Isak is that when you sign a player, you spread the cost over the life of the contract.

He was an academy player so that's pure profit.

Newcastle don't need to sell Isak to improve PSR,"Financial expert Kieran Maguire speaking on Sky Sports News' Transfer Talk: ""I think Newcastle United are in quite a strong PSR position to begin with.

Havertz missing from training amid injury fears,"Kai Havertz was not in Arsenal's open training session at the Emirates Stadium today amid reports he is set for a period on the sidelines with a knee injury. The German was not involved in the open training session put on by Arsenal at the fans. The Athletic claim the injury could mean Arsenal re-enter the transfer market for a new forward. With Gabriel Jesus still sidelined with an ACL injury, a setback to Havertz would leave just Viktor Gyokeres as their only natural centre forward option ahead of their Saturday Night Football match with Leeds, though Mikel Merino is another option for that role. Havertz was sidelined for a significant portion of the 2024/25 season due to a hamstring injury. He was used as a substitute during Sunday's 1-0 victory over Manchester United. Arsenal then travel to Premier League champions Liverpool on Super Sunday next weekend.

"Palace close to El Khannouss deal, still exploring Dibling","Latest from Sky Sports News' Rob Dorsett: Crystal Palace are close to agreeing a deal worth £32m with Leicester City for forward Bilal El Khannouss. However, Palace have not yet fully committed to the transfer – and they are still exploring a possible move for Southampton winger Tyler Dibling. Sky Sports News has been told there is broad agreement between Palace and Leicester over how the payments for El Khannouss would be structured. But progress has been temporarily halted while the Palace bosses consider their options. The South London club have had a long-term interest in Dibling. They made an offer for him in January. He would be a much more expensive option, however, considering Southampton have a £45m+ valuation. Everton have so far not been willing to meet that after seeing three separate bids rejected earlier in the window. But Dibling remains one of three forward options Everton are looking at with two weeks left including Malick Fofana and Leicester’s Abdul Fatawu.",20/08/2025

What would it take for Newcastle to sell Isak now?,"Latest from Sky Sports News' Keith Downie: ""Newcastle talked last night about the conditions of a sale. ""There were two conditions. ""One, the valuation of the player is £150 million. ""That is what Newcastle's valuation is. I still think they would probably do a deal for a little bit less than that. But I think Liverpool's £110m offer that landed a few weeks ago is way short. So if Liverpool were to really seriously want Isak, they would have to come to the table with a higher bid. ""The second is that Newcastle need to find a replacement. They tried on Benjamin Sesko, they tried on Hugo Ekitiki, failed on both of those. ""They're actually even struggling right now, as we can see, to bring in a replacement for Callum Wilson, who left on a free contract. We've been telling you for weeks now that they've been trying to sign Yoane Wissa from Brentford. But he's seen as the Callum Wilson replacement rather than the Alexander Isak replacement. ""So they can't even get the second striker in, if you like. ""If they were able to land Wissa in the next few days - and I am expecting a bid in the next couple of days - and Liverpool came to the table offering £130m then Newcastle might have a decision to make. ""However, it would leave them very light on striker reinforcements.""",20/08/2025
'Newcastle tried to find Isak replacements this summer',"Latest from Sky Sports News' Keith Downie: ""Newcastle have tried to facilitate [Isak's exit]. They tried to sign Hugo Ekitiki, who would have been a like-for-like replacement. They tried to sign Benjamin Sesko, who would have been a like-for-like replacement. And they've got down, right down to the nitty-gritty in both those deals and lost out, ironically, to Liverpool and then to Manchester United. ""Newcastle feel that they have tried. But just from the tone, the wording of their statement last night, it feels very much like a resignation that they're unable to or have been unable to get a replacement in with just under two weeks of the window left. ""It feels very much like they're digging their heels in and Alexander Isak will remain a Newcastle United player beyond the end of the transfer window.

If they were able to land Wissa in the next few days, and I am expecting a bid in the next couple of days and Liverpool came to the table offering £130 million then Newcastle might have a decision to make. ""If they are unable to bring in Wissa, then Isak will not be going anywhere and that was what the statement was saying last night. ""If they were to find a gem with two weeks of the window to go, and bring in Wissa and Liverpool came to the table with a significantly higher bid, then I think Isak will be allowed to go."" ""I think there's been a lot of people saying throughout this summer that Isak is not for sale. He's not for sale in that Newcastle don't want to lose him, but they were aware that he was unhappy, they were aware he was agitating to leave. They have tried to facilitate that, but the options for them in this window for a striker have been few and far between, and the two big-name strikers they have gone for, Ekitike and Sesko, they have lost out at the bitter end of tense negotiations. ""It feels very much like Newcastle have been angered by what Isak said on his social media last night, and that they will dig their heels in. ""I think the only way that Isak could go between now and the end of the transfer window is if they either manage to get two strikers in, which is going to prove really, really difficult, and Liverpool up their offer significantly, or B, they manage to bring in Wissa and Liverpool up their offer significantly, I think there's a small chance of that happening.""",20/08/2025

Gap in valuation between Man Utd and Chelsea for Garnacho,"There is a gap in valuation between Chelsea and Manchester United over a deal for Alejandro Garnacho. Man Utd reportedly value him at £50m, while Chelsea believe he is worth almost half that figure. Man Utd can point to the fact that he is an Argentina international, only 21 and players of a similar profile have been moving for around £50m, like Jamie Gittens and Noni Madueke. Chelsea believe Garnacho is worth less as he has no future at Old Trafford and wants to move to Chelsea. Some 15 players have left Chelsea this summer, and another nine are likely to leave. Cheslea need to sell more players, at the same time as bringing players in with Garnacho and RB Leipzig attacker Xavi Simons their top targets.",19/08/2025

Rodgers refuses to comment on Vardy to Celtic rumours,"Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers has declined to comment on reports linking Jamie Vardy with a move to Parkhead. Vardy is a free agent after leaving Leicester at the end of last season, and reports on Monday claimed that the 38-year-old striker had his heart set on a move to Celtic. Sky Sports News understands there has been no contact between Celtic and Vardy at this stage. “Listen, I would not speak about any individual player,” said Rodgers. “Of course I worked really well with Jamie, he was brilliant for me in my time at Leicester. But there’s been so many names floated about. I wouldn’t disclose either way.” Rodgers says he does not anticipate any last-gasp signings ahead of the Champions League play-offs. Celtic have until 11pm on Tuesday night to make up to two amendments to their European squad before hosting Kairat Almaty in the first leg on Wednesday. But Rodgers looks like he will need to continue waiting for the new attacking options he has been looking for. When asked if he now expected to go with the players who are already in the building, Rodgers said: “That’s what I am feeling at this moment in time. The players that we have will be the players that I trust that can do the job. “If we can get some players in before then, that would be amazing but the focus has been very much on what is here at this moment.”",19/08/2025

Romero key for Argentina’s World Cup defence after Tottenham extension,"South American football expert Tim Vickery on Sky Sports News: ""He’s got a huge year ahead, hasn’t he? Not only Champions League football for Tottenham, but something that probably goes even deeper in his psyche: Argentina’s bid to retain their crown in just under a year’s time. ""What Argentina will be trying to do next year has never been done, retain the World Cup on a different continent. And it’s basically the same defensive unit as the last World Cup, where it nearly collapsed game after game. ""We don’t know whether Argentina will be able to replace Nicolás Otamendi, the former Manchester City defender, who is now very much at the veteran stage. So Romero is going to have an absolutely vital task coordinating that defensive line for Argentina. ""I think he’s come to the decision that what he really needs now is stability. Hence the fact he’s signed on for Tottenham. That’s terrific news for Spurs, because probably the best part of their side is that world-class combination of centre-backs. So, great news for Tottenham, and a bit of stability for him as he builds towards the World Cup.""",19/08/2025

West Ham eye Chelsea’s Andrey Santos as midfield solution,"South American football expert Tim Vickery on Sky Sports News: ""Well, it depends what Chelsea want to do with him because they've got him on a long-term contract.  A central midfielder, he had a storming season last year for one of Chelsea's sister clubs, Strasbourg. He got into Carlo Ancelotti's first Brazil squad, and came off the bench in Ancelotti's first game. So this is a big season for him. ""Now, Brazil have problems in central midfield, and Andrey Santos is appearing as perhaps a solution. But he's got that problem at Chelsea, hasn’t he? With them stockpiling so many players. He has to get ahead of either Moisés Caicedo, who had an extraordinary season, or a World Cup winner in Enzo Fernández just to get a game. ""There’s been interest from West Ham, who look like they’re trying to move Edson Álvarez out, creating a hole in that central midfield area. Andrey Santos would be fabulous for filling that hole. But what does Chelsea want to do? Are they open to a move, even a loan move? This feels almost like a test case for the problems of keeping such a big squad happy. You’ve stockpiled so many players, but only 11 of them can be in the starting lineup.""",19/08/2025

Victor could attract Man Utd interest despite West Ham snub,"South American football expert Tim Vickery on Sky Sports News: ""Well, there were stories saying that West Ham had left him in the lurch. This, as I understand it, is not true. It was his decision in the end. A year ago, this happened with West Ham and a big Brazilian defender called Fabrício Bruno, who played for Brazil at Wembley. He’d agreed terms with his club Flamengo to join West Ham, and then the player decided he wasn’t getting paid enough. He weighed it up and didn’t move. It seems a similar thing happened to John Victor. ""Now, there was a question mark: would he be able to go back and play for Botafogo? Botafogo brought in Neto, the goalkeeper from Bournemouth, to replace him last Thursday night. But they did bring John back. I was in the stadium when they played a big game in the Copa Libertadores, and John was excellent, really, really excellent. There’s a little bit, when you saw the debut yesterday for Leeds of Lucas Perri, John’s predecessor in the Botafogo goal, and John is quite similar, quite a similar goalkeeper. ""And given the events at Old Trafford at the weekend, there’s been speculation that maybe United could look to bring him in. I would think it’s probably unlikely after he’s just rejected a move to England. But obviously, as we’ve seen from everything that’s happened in this window, even without Champions League football, United is still a very, very powerful draw. So if there is something concrete on the table for this player, maybe Manchester United will turn his head more than West Ham were able to.”",19/08/2025

Garnacho left out of Argentina squad amid World Cup build-up,"South American football expert Tim Vickery on Sky Sports News: “It most certainly has impacted his spot in the Argentina squad. Argentina called up a pre-list yesterday for those last two rounds of World Cup qualifiers. Echeverri is in, Garnacho is out. Now, this is significant because one of the big question marks that Argentina have building for next year's World Cup is how on earth do you replace Di María? And Garnacho seemed the heir apparent as the man to run the wings. But it hasn't quite happened for him. And so these are important moments. He really needs to get out there playing to kickstart his claim to get back in that Argentina squad in the run-up to the World Cup.”",19/08/2025

Man City’s ‘El Diablito’ Echeverri linked with shock Dortmund loan move,"South American football expert Tim Vickery on Sky Sports News: ""Yeah, I am, more flabbergasted than surprised, that he could be on his way out, actually, given, number one, City perhaps unwisely letting Cole Palmer and Julián Álvarez go, so becoming a little light, perhaps, in that area. ""Number two, Claudio “El Diablito” Echeverri - he just makes things happen. He's an electric little figure. We've seen this already in his limited appearances for Man City. And on his debut, he nearly saved the FA Cup final, scored for them in the Club World Cup. So you're expecting him to kick on and really be a key part of the team this season and then at the weekend, he's not even on the team sheet. ""So yes, a big surprise to me, and Argentina think the world of him. He's in the squad for the last two rounds of World Cup qualifiers coming up early next month. So I'm very, very surprised. The news would seem to be that Dortmund are interested in a loan move with an option to buy. We will see over the next few hours what City's position is on this very, very promising young player.""",19/08/2025

He believes the club is being difficult, and the move Wissa made on Monday in deleting all traces of Brentford from his social media was a representation of his current stance. Newcastle have been expected to move again for Wissa, despite Brentford's club-record signing of Dango Ouattara giving no guarantees he would be sold, but it has not come yet. There has been no new contact between Newcastle and Brentford so far this week, and there is no new bid on the table as things stand. Wissa has been of interest to several clubs since January and has been talking to Brentford about a potential exit since then - and he is adamant he was given assurances he would be allowed to go. Brentford sources insist he has never been given any such assurances, however. The club are willing to engage with Newcastle, but his valuation must be met, and they want to replace him.

Forest close in on three signings with Hudson-Odoi to extend stay,"Latest from Sky Sports News' Kaveh Solhekol, Dharmesh Sheth & Rob Dorsett: Nottingham Forest are on the verge of completing four major signings - 24 hours after Nuno Espirito Santo criticised the club for being “very far from where we should be, in terms of the squad.” The Forest boss was uncharacteristically outspoken against his employers in an exclusive interview with Sky Sports yesterday, where he said: “We are very far from where we should be, in terms of planning, in terms of preparation, in terms of the squad. We lost a very good opportunity to do things better. We have a squad that is unbalanced, doesn’t have many options in many positions - we are taking a risk.” Sky Sports News reported earlier this week that the CAS decision to maintain Forest’s place in the Europa League (at the expense of Crystal Palace) would act as a starting pistol for owner Evangelos Marinakis to sanction a number of new transfer deals. Now, we have been told Omari Hutchinson is due to undergo a medical in Nottingham today, after a fee of £37.5m, and a mutual structure of payments, has been agreed with Ipswich Town. Three other clubs tried to hijack Hutchinson’s move to the City Ground, but the player decided he wanted to join Forest. He is expected to travel to Nottingham later today to undergo a medical. Similarly, James McAtee is due to undergo a medical after a £30m fee was agreed yesterday with Manchester City. McAtee was at the Man City training ground this morning to say his goodbyes, ahead of his move to Nottingham Forest. Callum Hudson-Odoi (who has only 12 months remaining on his existing deal) has verbally agreed the terms of a new and improved contract at the City Ground, and he is expected to sign the paperwork shortly. And a deal is close for Stade Rennais striker Arnaud Kalimuendo, with Forest closing in on deal which we are told could be worth up to £25m.",15/08/2025

Rashford still not registered for Barcelona,"Latest from Sky Sports News' Lyall Thomas: Barcelona are still trying to register Marcus Rashford ahead of their opening game of the season. The club are working hard to register him ahead of their other new players before Saturday evening’s clash away at Mallorca.

It’s understood if a market opportunity presented itself with Baleba, United would want to be in a position to act.

Zinchenko discusses Arsenal future,"Oleksandr Zinchenko has described last season as ""easily the worst season I ever experienced as a professional"" amid limited game time at Arsenal - and revealed his desire to play more. The 28-year-old made just 15 Premier League appearances for the Gunners last season - starting just five games. The summer signing of Riccardo Calafiori plus the emergence of Myles Lewis-Skelly was partly to blame, with Zinchenko linked with a move away from the Emirates Stadium this summer. ""I was basically out of the starting XI altogether, bar a few isolated matches,"" Zinchenko wrote in a new chapter of his autobiography Believe. ""In pure personal terms, it was easily the worst season I ever experienced as a professional. A player who doesn’t play is nothing. ""I’ve never been a player who runs to the manager, com­plains or asks tonnes of questions. I can only blame myself. If I don’t play, it means that I didn’t work hard enough, didn’t do enough, didn’t play well enough. ""Let’s see what time will bring. Because I still want to play football. I want to enjoy the game and come back with a smile on my face in the evening.""",13/08/2025

Calvert-Lewin left Everton upon the expiry of his contract earlier this summer. He was one of the options Leeds looked at earlier in the summer, however the deal was viewed as a difficult one to do at that stage. Leeds had been staying patient in their pursuit of Rodrigo Muniz, who has been their top striker target this summer. However, they were facing a tough task to prise him from Fulham - and then Atalanta made their move. Sky Sports News reported yesterday that Muniz is keen to explore a move to the Italian club, who are playing in the Champions League next season. Fulham do not want to sell the striker and would be even more reluctant to send him to a Premier League rival. Leeds subsequently decided to revisit the potential of a free transfer for Calvert-Lewin.",13/08/2025

The offer is made up of a guaranteed £30m fee plus bonuses up to a further £4.5m. The player is keen on the move but Fulham want him to stay and would find it very difficult to let him go without an adequate replacement. Muniz has a year left on his contract - but significantly Fulham have the option to extend for a further year. Fulham have still not signed any new players of their own yet this summer, with manager Marco Silva keen to add two new wingers, a striker and maybe an advanced midfielder.

City want Ederson to stay,"Latest from Sky Sports News' Lyall Thomas & Adrian Kajumba Manchester City want Ederson to stay at the club and remain their number one goalkeeper.

Ederson has been of interest to Galatasaray in Turkey and clubs in Saudi Arabia - and if an offer arrived for him before the deadline then City will have a decision to make. Part of that decision will also be looking for a potential replacement and Paris Saint-Germain's Gianluigi Donnarumma is a player City have tracked for a long time. However, they are not negotiating with PSG for the Italian as things stand. One source has even indicated to Sky Sports News that he has been considered as a potential free transfer option for next year.

Analysis: Guehi quality clear - but where he fits for Liverpool not so straightforward,"Sky Sports' Peter Smith: ""Marc Guehi has established himself as one of the Premier League's elite centre-backs, the 25-year-old is first-choice for England and, after leading Crystal Palace to back-to-back trophy successes at Wembley, looks like an absolute bargain signing at around £40m. ""Liverpool have opened talks with Palace, whose chairman Steve Parish admitted it makes sense to cash in if the one year left on Guehi's contract can't be extended. Guehi is also believed to be open to an Anfield switch and Reds boss Arne Slot is in need of defensive reinforcements. ""But while that all adds up, where Guehi would actually fit into Liverpool's team is not quite so straightforward. ""Guehi plays on the left of a back three at Crystal Palace. He has shown with England he can play on the left side of a back four - the preferred set-up at Liverpool and of Slot - but that is where captain Virgil van Dijk plays. The Dutchman started 37 of 38 Premier League games last season. ""The assumption seems to be that Guehi would play alongside Van Dijk, in place of Ibrahima Konate, who only has a year to run on his own Liverpool deal. Being a right-footer, it's not a huge leap for Guehi but does require some adaptation - and breaks up a championship-winning partnership. ""With Van Dijk aged 34 and Konate's contract situation uncertain, Guehi would future-proof the Liverpool defence. But does he want to risk being a back-up or rotation option at Liverpool in a World Cup year? ""A creative alternative could be for Slot to turn to an unfamiliar back three, with Guehi remaining in his favoured left-side role, Van Dijk orchestrating affairs from the centre, and Konate protecting the right channel, as he is skilled to do. ""That could also help rebalance a Liverpool defence which Slot admitted needed ""adjustment"" after they were opened up through pre-season, with the adventurous new signings Milos Kerkez and Jeremie Frimpong leaving the centre-backs vulnerable. ""Any which way, it requires a shift from Guehi or Liverpool - but it could be a conundrum both the player and Premier League champions believe is worth taking on.""",13/08/2025

Rashford: Man Utd are in no man's land - they need to stick to plan,"Marcus Rashford has described ""reactionary"" Manchester United as being in ""no man's land"" - and has called on his club to ""make a plan and stick to it."" Rashford departed United to join Barcelona on loan for the upcoming season but has hit out at the club's strategy in recent years. Speaking on the Rest is Football, Rashford said: “You see it with any team that’s been successful over a period of time: they have principles that any coach that comes in, any player that comes in, has to align to these principles or be able to add to these principles. “Whereas at times I feel like United have just been … we’re hungry to win, so we’ll always try to adapt and to sign players that fit this system. But it’s reactionary. “If your direction’s always changing, you can’t expect to be able to win the league. “Yeah, you might win some cup tournaments, but it’s because you do have a good coach and you do have good players and you have match winners in your team – you’re not there by accident. “This is what some people forget. So yeah, we’ve been way below where we deem United to be. But then if you take a step back, which I’ve been able to do, especially over the last six months – what do you expect? “People say we’ve been in a transition for years. To be in a transition, you have to start the transition. So it’s like the actual transition’s not started yet. “To start a transition, you have to make a plan and stick to it. So this is the thing that I feel – it’s not easy. Because if it’s not going well, the fans demand [change]. “But this is where I speak about being realistic with what your situation is. “I feel like we’ve had that many different managers and different ideas and different strategies in order to win … you end up in the middle of – you end up in no man’s land.”",13/08/2025

'Everton move vital for Grealish to accelerate career',"Sky Sports News' Rob Dorsett: David Moyes is a huge admirer of Jack Grealish and thinks he could do a really good job for Everton. That probably means using him as a No 10 rather than as a left winger, because with Iliman Ndiaye and other options they have got on the left-hand side, Grealish would not naturally slot in in that position. So that is an interesting one. But this is a player who will be fully aware there is a World Cup on the horizon next summer, and he has not been part of Thomas Tuchel's plans as of yet. So this is vital to accelerate his career. As things stand, he is absolutely miles off even being considered for selection by Tuchel because he is just not playing enough games. Everybody has been talking about the fact that Grealish needs to move on. Pep Guardiola offered no guarantees he would remain at the club for this season, and certainly didn't offer any guarantees about how many games he would play. It is very, very obvious from all of what happened last season that he is not part of Man City's plans. He made just one Premier League start in 2024/25. He was an unused substitute in the FA Cup final. And that is a £100m club-record signing. So it makes sense from all parties. It is pretty clear that David Moyes and Everton have pretty ambitious plans right now and it looks like Grealish will be pulling on an Everton shirt at their new stadium.",12/08/2025

utilised. However, Martin felt Raskin made a ""big, big difference"" when he came on in Saturday's 1-1 draw with Dundee and believes the 24-year-old is shaking off transfer speculation. Speaking ahead of Tuesday's second leg against the Czech side, Martin said:
""What Nico did last season, rightly or wrongly, I can't have a feeling about. ""He came out of the team for reasons that me and him spoke about. And his reaction has been top, like really, really brilliant. And that's all you can ever ask for. ""There's been a bit of uncertainty about him this summer, for sure. Not from people ringing us, but I think from people ringing him, definitely. ""So I think that's affected his approach. Not in terms of professionalism, but he's a young man, of course it's going to have an impact at some point. ""And then we've had a discussion and since he came out of the team, he's been a different guy. Incredible."" Martin added: ""Hopefully we can get to the end of the window, he's played brilliantly, the window shuts, he's still here. And then we can keep improving and keep kicking on.""",11/08/2025

'Increasingly likely' Isak remains at Newcastle,"Sky Sports News' Keith Downie at St James' Park: ""It's becoming a bit of a toxic situation, not what Newcastle want ahead of the new season. ""Eddie Howe says he doesn't see it changing ahead of the trip to Villa Park next weekend. ""I don't think we're going to see anything definitive to this situation until the transfer window is closed.

""It feels like the options for Newcastle are very thin on the ground after they missed out on Benjamin Sesko, so I think as the days go on it's becoming increasingly likely Isak remains a Newcastle player this window.

Maguire hopeful ‘fresh start’ can lead to change in Man Utd fortunes,"Harry Maguire believes Manchester United have a “fresh start” as they head into a new season seeking to atone for a dire past 12 months. United’s post-Ferguson malaise hit an all-time low after a 15th-placed finish – their worst ever in the Premier League – and not even a run to the Europa League final, where they lost to Tottenham, could paper over the cracks. But the big-name signings of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko, as well as a £50m training ground upgrade, have given United a spring in their step to go into the new campaign. They welcome old rivals Arsenal in their season opener on Sunday and Maguire, appearing on the Rio Ferdinand Presents podcast, said: “The lads are working hard and it’s a great atmosphere in the place. “We want to be successful, we’re doing everything we can to be successful. Sometimes we know it’s not been good enough for a recent (period) and we’ve not given our fans as much. “I feel like it’s almost a little bit of a fresh start and hopefully this start is a good start.”",11/08/2025

Rodgers believes Yamada made positive impact on debut,"Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers felt new striker Shin Yamada made a positive impact on his debut. Yamada came on midway through the second half at Pittodrie on Sunday, immediately after fellow Japan international Reo Hatate had scored Celtic’s second goal in a 2-0 win over Aberdeen. The 24-year-old was midway through the J-League campaign when he arrived from Kawasaki Frontale in late July but is being eased into the Celtic team by Rodgers, who is still looking to add to his front line. Yamada came on for Adam Idah, linked play well a few times and tried some flicks which did not quite come off. His best moment was in his own penalty box when he produced a crucial intervention to put Dante Polvara off his stride as the Aberdeen midfielder looked set to capitalise on a loose ball following a set-piece. Rodgers said: “It’s (trying to find) moments in games when you can use them. So, yes, it was important. I wanted to see him in a game where there’s something really on it, away from home, and seeing his physicality in the game. “He’s got lots of things he needs to work on, but he’s got a good attitude and he wants to get better. “He’ll feel, coming into the game, that he was positive in his play.”",11/08/2025

That’s what football clubs do,” said Palace chairman Parish. “If you just don’t care about reinvigorating the team, you don’t care about tomorrow, ever, you just put it all off. “Then, we’re a fantastic team, you know and if we had four more players, I don’t know what we could achieve but unfortunately it’s not always as simple as that.” Parish pointed to the “crazy” and “just nuts” fees for players and the club’s outgoings this year. “We’ll have to see,” added the chairman. “We’ll do whatever we can. We won’t stop working and we will do whatever we can. “But as far as people being here or not being here, it depends. If it’s the right decision for the football club and for them, nobody can make anyone go, then there will be some changes, but you’ve got to make smart ones.”",11/08/2025

Parish admits Crystal Palace may have to sell Guehi this summer,"Crystal Palace chairman Steve Parish admitted the club could be forced to consider selling captain Marc Guehi this summer. The Eagles came back to beat Liverpool in a penalty shoot-out and lift the Community Shield at Wembley. Palace’s second piece of silverware in 86 days – after winning the FA Cup in May – was a welcome reprieve from their ongoing legal battle, with the Court of Arbitration of Sport (CAS) expected to rule on Monday whether they will play in the Europa League or Conference League this season. Guehi’s contract expires at the end of this campaign and Sunday’s opponents Liverpool are thought to be frontrunners to secure the signature of the 25-year-old England defender. “Yes. I mean, we’d have to, of course,” said Parish, who is also co-owner, when asked if he would seriously entertain tempting bids for his skipper over the next three weeks. “For players of that calibre to leave on a free, it’s a problem. No doubt about it, unfortunately. “We had one bid (last summer) but Joachim (Andersen) went (to Fulham) and we couldn’t afford to lose both of them. We then had another bid in January but that was a difficult situation as well, and the player had a point of view on that one. “So we just have to see what happens but it needs a new contract or a conclusion of some kind.”",11/08/2025

"Idah needs competition to thrive, says Celtic boss Rodgers","Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers claims Adam Idah will be better if he can get some competition up front. The champions eased to a 2-0 win at Aberdeen thanks to goals in either half from midfielders Benjamin Nygren and Reo Hatate, but Idah struggled to make an impact in the centre-forward position. The 24-year-old was expected to kick on after Kyogo Furuhashi left in January, but Daizen Maeda took on the mantle of Celtic’s main goalscorer after moving inside from a wide position, although the Irishman still finished on 20 goals. Given Celtic have since lost Jota to a long-term injury and sold Nicolas Kuhn, Maeda has been needed out wide, while Idah has been handed a chance to seize the number-nine role. “There’s no doubt that we need to reinforce the top line,” Rodgers said. “There’s no doubt. “I’m really pleased with where we are structurally in defensive numbers. We’ve got a squad from our back line to midfield that can cope domestically and cope in the European competition. So I’m really pleased with that aspect. “But I think we need competition at the top end of the field. “For Adam, he’s a big, honest boy. He was at his best here when was really challenging with Kyogo for the position and that’s something that is important for us to get.

'Timing not right for Baleba sale',"Sky Sports News' Elliot Cook: Manchester United have made their first move for Carlos Baleba but will Brighton actually sell the Cameroon international midfielder this window? The chances are very remote. Brighton make no secret of their model - buy talented young players based on Tony Bloom's effective analytics system in a finely tuned recruitment process - and sell them on when their value is realised, when the time is right for the club and the player. Also, and this is crucial, when there is a replacement for him to step into the first team. Money talks in football of course, but the timing doesn't feel right from Brighton's perspective. Baleba was purchased for around £25m in August 2023. His value now will have rocketed, and his ceiling is considered to be higher than that of former midfielder Moises Caicedo. 19-year-old Malick Yalcouye is thought to be a similar type of midfielder to Baleba but he is young and has only had one loan away from the club to develop. One day he could fill Baleba's shoes, but now it is surely too early for him.",06/08/2025

Having brought in Viktor Gyokeres, Martin Zubimendi, Christian Norgaard, Cristhian Mosquera as well as Noni Madueke and Kepa Arrizabalaga from Chelsea, Arteta feels he has significantly strengthened the core of his squad to last the distance in the title race. “These new arrivals all add quality and depth to the squad, which is what we are going to need throughout the season ahead,” Arteta wrote in his programme notes ahead of Wednesday night’s friendly against Villarreal. “We know what our targets are and what we want to achieve this season – there is a big belief in our ability to achieve that. “We have been very, very close the last few seasons and the whole team is going to determine whether we achieve that or not. “But at the same time, we have to make sure that we don’t lose sight of what we have to do on a daily basis to get to the levels that we want. “We have to set the demands that we want within this goal, because that’s the most important thing – the internal demands have to always exceed any external demand. That is what we are trying to achieve every single day.”",06/08/2025

Everton approach Man City over Grealish deal,"Latest from Sky Sports News' Vinny O'Connor, Anthony Joseph and Rob Dorsett: Everton have approached Manchester City over a possible deal to sign Jack Grealish. Talks will focus on the possibility of a season-long loan, though negotiations are at an early stage. He is a player much admired by David Moyes. It is expected that if a deal is to materialise, it is likely to be later in the window. Grealish is desperate for more game time as he looks to force his way into Thomas Tuchel’s thinking for next summer’s World Cup. He has been working with a personal trainer in a bid to make sure he is in the best possible condition for the season to come. Pep Guardiola has offered no guarantees Grealish will remain at the Etihad, and the £100m club-record signing has been struggling for regular games. He made just one Premier League start last season, and was an unused substitute at Wembley for the FA Cup final defeat to Crystal Palace. However, Grealish remains one of the biggest earners at the Etihad, and it is understood that it would be difficult for Everton to afford all of his wages, which are thought to be worth £300,000 per week. That issue will now be the focus of talks between Everton and Man City, as they try to reach an agreement over how his salary will be shared.",06/08/2025

If Manchester United get Benjamin Sesko over the line, their front three next season, Bryan Mbuemo, Sesko and Matheus Cunha are three players that Newcastle liked and certainly tried and got far on with two of them in the shape of Sesko and Mbeumo. “By my last count there was eight players that Newcastle have just missed out on, so it's been a bruising summer for them. “I think this one will be the hardest one of all, seeing Benjamin Sesko join Manchester United.”",06/08/2025

Could Rodrygo be on the move this summer?,"South American football expert Tim Vickery on Sky Sports News discussing Rodrygo, who has been a reported target for Arsenal: ""Let’s watch this space over the next few weeks because this could be interesting. ""Rodrygo has the Real Madrid dilemma that it’s hard for players to be top dog there and he’s so talented – almost absurdly talented. ""But someone has to do the hard yards and Jude Bellingham said last year that he considered Rodrygo the most talented of all of them and the one who has to sacrifice himself the most for the side. ""Where does Xabi Alonso see him? Because he can play anywhere across the front line. He didn’t use him very much in the Club World Cup and when he did, it was wide right. ""We know Rodrygo doesn’t want to play wide right. He would far prefer a free role. Now what we understand is that he’s very keen on staying at Real Madrid and proving that he can be a key part of that side. ""Over the next two weeks , if that doesn’t happen, then he might start looking around and what an asset he would be. ""It’s a waste to have him as a bit-part player, filling in spaces or playing wide on the right. You want him roaming free, dropping his little bombs all around the opposing goal.""",06/08/2025
Vickery: John has nothing to fear in Premier League with West Ham,"South American football expert Tim Vickery on Sky Sports News discussing Botafogo goalkeeper John Victor's proposed move to West Ham: ""The point here is it is two former Botafogo goalkeepers going to the Premier League, with Lucas Perri joining Leeds through Lyon and John – he’s only known as John over here – is well down the road to joining West Ham. ""There’s two points to make – the first is the excellence of Botafogo’s scouting system, who pick up these players when they’re reserves, like Lucas Perri was, or John was on loan in the Spanish second division with Valladolid. ""When they brought him back last year, he was an essential part of the team that won the Brazilian title and the Copa Libertadores. He had an excellent tournament recently in the Club World Cup. ""Brazil is really becoming a mass producer of goalkeepers and John is right in that mould. He’s tall, athletic, live and very impressive. John has given wonderful service to Botafogo, he’s been really dependable. ""The only thing you would say at this stage is I don’t think he has the language… defending is a collective task and it is vital that the goalkeeper is able to communicate with his defensive unit. ""So John would need some time getting up to speed with that, but in terms of his abilities, I don’t think he has anything to fear in the Premier League and he can give West Ham equally good service as he gave to Botafogo.""",06/08/2025
Have Newcastle been strung along in Sesko deal?,"Latest from Sky Sports News' Keith Downie: “I think there's a mixture of disappointment and also probably of feeling in the dark a little bit over the Sesko deal. I think the fear from Newcastle at the start of the week was that they might get strung along in this with Manchester United on Monday still having yet to make a formal bid for Benjamin Sesko. “It feels like they've given everything they can and they've really thrown the kitchen sink at it. But just the noises you're hearing from inside and one source that has been telling us or maintaining to us for days now that Manchester United is Sesko’s favoured destination. “I don't think it was that he is or was against Newcastle United. ""I think he was impressed with the plan and the project that was laid out by Eddie Howe last week when he spoke to Sesko and his representatives. But I think just the pull of Manchester United, an institution of a football club. Newcastle have lost out on a couple of players to Manchester United, the likes of Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo already this summer.”",06/08/2025

He’s an optimist of the goal - he’s always trying, always putting himself around, running into the channels. ""Although there are some Liverpool fans who have a resistance to him, there are many who really appreciate his efforts. ""This year, going into the World Cup, it’s an important move to make and he may come to the conclusion that going to Saudi will leave him fresher for the World Cup, but he would be a loss to the Premier League.""

""But that just adds a bit more intrigue to the Isak situation because there's another spot up for grabs in that Liverpool attack with Nunez about to leave. “So that will be interesting to see what happens there and whether Liverpool still come back in despite the fact Newcastle have yet to essentially replace or bring in a replacement for Isak.”",06/08/2025

Coventry consider club-record bid for Hughes,"Latest from Sky Sports News' James Savundra and Rob Dorsett: Coventry are considering a club-record bid for Hull's highly rated 21-year-old defender Charlie Hughes, having seen an initial offer worth £7m rejected. Coventry told Hull they were prepared to pay a guaranteed £6m with a further £1m in potential add-ons, but that was rebuffed. Sky Sports News has been told they are now considering an increased offer of £8m plus add-ons for Hughes, which would be a new club-record fee. Coventry play Hull in their season-opener, live on Sky Sports, on Saturday lunchtime. Hull value their current young player of the season at £10m and are reluctant to sell a key member of their first team - especially to a rival, and especially with the club under a transfer embargo which means they can’t immediately use the money to replace him. However, Hull are due to have their appeal against the embargo heard later today.

Carragher: I want Liverpool to sign Isak - but £150m is Mbappe money!,"Sky Sports pundit Jamie Carragher says signing Alexander Isak would be 'amazing' for Liverpool, but questioned the high price tag. He added that the situation with Isak at Newcastle seems 'messy', with the striker missing out of the club's pre-season tour of Asia. Speaking on The Overlap, he said: ""It will be an amazing signing. ""From a Liverpool fan point of view, I don’t want the club to spend £150m on Isak. I could probably imagine that he was Liverpool’s No1 target but there’s something about Liverpool buying a striker [Ekitike] for £80m and he’s a back-up. There’s something about it that doesn’t sit right to me. ""I look at Isak, he’s obviously thrown his toys out pram once Arsenal and Liverpool signed a striker. From him and his agent’s point of view, did they not tell Newcastle months ago that they wanted to move on? It just seems a little bit messy. ""When I think of Liverpool, it doesn’t look really planned. I don’t think the plan is to sign a striker for £80m and sign one for £120m. ""I feel for Ekitike a little bit. Because he’s been brought in and then all of a sudden this Isak thing has come. ""I do want Liverpool to sign Isak, but £150m for me feels like a Mbappe.

Andrews: Wissa transfer situation not ideal,"Brentford head coach Keith Andrews has admitted the uncertainty around Yoane Wissa's future is not ideal following the departures of Bryan Mbeumo and former captain Christian Norgaard already this summer. Wissa played no part in Brentford's 1-0 friendly loss to QPR on Saturday amid interest in the striker from Newcastle. ""The situation is that he is training at the training ground,"" Andrews told Sky Sports News. ""It’s probably public knowledge at this stage that he left our training camp in Lisbon. That was probably the right decision for all parties. We had to support him in what is a difficult time for him. ""I think we have to remember that it’s not just about being a footballer, it’s the person and the human being first. ""Again, it's public knowledge that there is some interest in Wiss. We have to respect that and respect him. ""I have got a really good relationship with Yoane from last season and that’s still the case now, but obviously it’s not ideal."" Andrews added: ""We have constant communication with Yoane around the situation. I think he’s OK to a point. I’ve been in this situation myself as a player and it can be stressful for an individual. I think that’s where it goes back to what are club’s about and how it’s run from the top. We always treat people with respect. ""When you look at the business we’ve done this season, the outgoings have been done early. This is probably not wanted or desired, certainly from my point of view. It’s not an ideal scenario but it’s what the transfer window is.""",02/08/2025

Saturday morning's transfer headlines!,Here are the Saturday morning headlines from the Transfer Centre:,02/08/2025
Analysis: Son a Spurs and Premier League icon,"Sky Sports' Sam Blitz: Heung-Min Son will go down as one of Tottenham Hotspur's standout players of the modern era. There is even a fair argument to say he is the standalone Spurs icon of this generation. Harry Kane may be Spurs' all-time record goalscorer, but Son will always be remembered as the one who stayed. Sky Sports Kane gave Spurs fans more goalscoring moments down the years but Son holds just one moment - the trophy lift in Bilbao - which stands above all in terms of Spurs' recent history. And it is worth remembering that many of Kane's goals came from Son's assists. Statistically speaking, Son was one half of the deadliest striker partnership in Premier League history. Son and Kane set each other up 47 times across 229 games together - no Premier League pair has managed more. The 2020/21 campaign was the highlight of their partnership, with their 14 assists for goals between them the most in a single season. Thomas Frank described the South Korean as one of the greatest Premier League wingers of all time and his numbers are definitely up there. Not only is he fourth on Spurs' all-time top goalscorers list but he is 16th on the Premier League's scorers chart - and one of only 34 players to be in the Premier League 100 goals club. Since his Premier League debut, only Mohamed Salah has more goal contributions. Son even has more than Kevin de Bruyne in that time, despite the Belgian joining Manchester City in the same summer that Son arrived at Spurs. All that plus a lovable character that even rivals fans could not argue against, it highlights that Son is not just a Spurs legend, but a Premier League one too.",02/08/2025

Howe: Newcastle only looking for the best,"Eddie Howe has added that Newcastle are only ""looking for the best"" in terms of transfer targets amid a challenging window for the club. Not only have the Magpies been hit with Alexander Isak's desire to leave, but they have also missed out on a number of transfer targets to rivals, including Liam Delap, Joao Pedro, Hugo Ekitike and James Trafford. Newcastle have also hit a roadblock in their pursuit of Brentford forward Yoane Wissa. With Callum Wilson departing earlier this summer, it leaves just Will Osula as their only recognised first-team striker on their pre-season tour of Asia. ""We're looking for the best players that we can get,"" said Howe. ""Whatever our target position is, we're looking for the best so I see all situations open and available to us. ""I feel that's the only way that we're going to get to where we want to go, which is to maximise, and it's quality over quantity. It always has been. That's always been the way that we try to work and the way that we try to recruit, and I think we've done it pretty well to this point. ""It's been a challenging summer, because we've missed out on various targets for loads of different reasons, but we're still very competitive, and we're still in there trying to bring very good players to the club - and that won't change til the window shuts.""",02/08/2025
Howe not sure on next steps after Isak bid rejected,"Newcastle manager Eddie Howe has confirmed that the club have turned down a bid from Liverpool for Alexander Isak - but is unsure on what will happen next. Sky Sports News understands Liverpool's opening offer for Isak  was £110m plus add-ons. However, the total offer did not reach £120m. ""From my situation I am very much removed from what was happening back home,"" said Howe in a press conference. ""I was made aware of a bid yesterday and that bid was turned down all before I even heard about it. People back in England are dealing with the situation. ""I really don't know what happens next. From our perspective, we still support Alex in every way, and my wish is that we see him in a Newcastle shirt again. ""It is difficult because you don't know what is going to happen. There can be all sorts of talk and hypothetical situations but then you are dealing with reality. ""The reality is we had the first bid from Liverpool yesterday. I believe that was turned down, from this point onwards let's see what happens. ""I have no idea to try to predict that. In terms of trying to upset players, from my perspective, we can only talk about us, we try to do things the right way, signing players is always complex, we just try to do what we think is right. ""I can't talk about other clubs, that is not for me to say.""",02/08/2025

Spurs head coach Thomas Frank has confirmed that Son will start and captain the team on Sunday. Son wants to move to Major League Soccer despite renewed interest from Saudi Arabia. The MLS and LAFC, who have been strongly linked to the player, will now accelerate talks with Spurs over Son's transfer. ""I have decided to leave the Club this summer. Respectfully the club is helping me with this decision. ""It was the most difficult decision I have made in my career. Such amazing memories. It was so hard to make the decision. ""I need a new environment to push myself. I need a little bit of change - 10 years is a long time. I came to north London as a kid, 23 years old, such a young age. I leave this club as a grown man, a very proud man. ""I want to say thank you to all the Spurs fans for giving me so much love. I hope the goodbye is also good timing and this is the right time to make that decision.

""It feels like Donnarumma has gone to even greater heights this season, playing a crucial role in Paris St-Germain's incredible season. ""Commanding in Ligue 1, a shootout star against Liverpool in the Champions League and formidable with five clean sheets in eight games at the Club World Cup, Donnarumma would be a huge coup for United if they could get a deal done. ""Andre Onana has been in the spotlight since he had that let-off against Wolves in his Premier League debut and uncertainty about the current United keeper has fed the nervousness and lack of conviction about Ruben Amorim's backline. ""His total of eight errors leading to goals since the start of 2023/24 is more than any other goalkeeper in the Premier League. Donnarumma would be a substantial upgrade.""",01/08/2025

""Newcastle's valuation is £150m and they don't have a replacement lined up. They want a top-level striker to come in. ""My feeling is, this needs to be sorted swiftly. I don't see it dragging on until the end of August, purely because of the numbers involved. ""Now that they have put a formal offer in, it is more likely that it will get done.

""It is a bid in excess of £100m, we don't know the exact figure at this stage. ""Newcastle have rejected the offer.

He really is an astonishing talent, it's a significant moment - you could argue the Premier League has never had a top-drawer Brazilian star. They favour Barcelona or Real Madrid. ""His agent said a few months ago that he picked Chelsea because they were the club most willing to see him as a No 10. I wonder how conversations with Cole Palmer have gone on that?

Analysis: Why Donnarumma would be an upgrade on Onana,"Sky Sports' Peter Smith: ""Gianluigi Donnarumma would be a massive signing for Man Utd - both literally and figuratively. ""The 6ft5in Italy shot-stopper is an enormous presence in the goalmouth and is regarded as one of the best goalkeepers in the business. ""It feels like Donnarumma has gone to even greater heights this season, playing a crucial role in Paris St-Germain's incredible season. ""Commanding in Ligue 1, a shootout star against Liverpool in the Champions League and formidable with five clean sheets in eight games at the Club World Cup, Donnarumma would be a huge coup for United if they could get a deal done. ""Andre Onana has been in the spotlight since he had that let-off against Wolves in his Premier League debut and uncertainty about the current United keeper has fed the nervousness and lack of conviction about Ruben Amorim's backline. ""His total of eight errors leading to goals since the start of 2023/24 is more than any other goalkeeper in the Premier League. Donnarumma would be a substantial upgrade.""",01/08/2025

Friday's transfer round-up,Sky Sports,01/08/2025
Analysis: Palhinha would add bite to Spurs midfield,"Sky Sports' Peter Smith: ""Joao Palhinha left the Premier League last summer as the toughest tackler in the top flight. His total of 152 tackles was more than any other player by a distance and was the standout trait of the Fulham enforcer. There were 13 yellows in that 2023/24 season, too, underlining the bite he brings to midfield battles. And that would be a welcome addition to Spurs' play. ""Neither Yves Bissouma, Pape Sarr nor Rodrigo Bentancur are as ruthless at winning the ball back as Palhinha, who also ranked among the top 10 for interceptions during his previous Premier League campaign. ""Palhinha's belated move to Bayern Munich didn't prove to be worth the wait, with an injury disruptive and head coach Vincent Kompany ultimately leaving him on the fringes. But a return to London looks like a smart switch for the Portuguese and Spurs - and a daunting one for opposition midfielders.""",01/08/2025

You see straight away the energy and the quality they are going to bring,"" Arteta said, as quoted by football.london. ""It was a short one, but at least that one is over now, and when they play against Villareal now, I'm sure it will be different."" Sky Sports",01/08/2025

It’s mad – Williams in dreamland after first senior goal for Man Utd,"Ethan Williams feels “blessed” after the late callup to Manchester United’s preseason tour squad scored a superb first senior goal for his hometown club. The 19-year-old academy product ended last season on loan at Cheltenham, scoring two goals in 17 appearances during a fruitful spell in League Two. Williams had expected to spend much of this summer working with the U21s, only for Red Devils boss Ruben Amorim to last week give him the nod for their preseason tour to the United States. A whirlwind week peaked on Wednesday night in Chicago, where he replaced Amad Diallo in the 70th minute and went on to score a fine strike in a promising 4-1 win over Bournemouth. “It’s mad, I can’t believe it,” Williams said. “It still hasn’t really sunk in, to be honest. It’s a dream come true and I’m so happy right now. “I’m thinking about all the moments, all the hard work I’ve been through,” he said. “You know, I feel so blessed and so happy to be given this opportunity. “To score, it’s mad. I can’t even explain how I am feeling, to be honest.” Williams was an unused substitute in their first Premier League Summer Series friendly against West Ham at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey, where next year’s World Cup final will be held. It is a position the winger did not expect to find himself in at the start of last week, when he was primed to stay home having been an unused substitute in the senior side’s pre-season opener against Leeds. “It was last minute,” Williams told club media. “I was kind of told I wasn’t [going] and then I was. “I remember just… not really jumping around the bedroom, but I was buzzing. “I’ve been trying to train well as these guys are the best players I’ve ever trained with, know what I mean? To be around it and be learning every single day is a real blessing and I’m just thankful for it all.”",31/07/2025

And as we reported just over a week ago, he's told Newcastle that he wants to explore his options this summer after that informal approach from Liverpool just over two weeks ago. ""Newcastle are away right now. They're over in South Korea as part of their preseason tour, playing a couple of matches there. So all the players, the management, his backroom staff, physios, doctors, everyone is all over there. Sky Sports ""Isak was the one that remained due to the fact that he had what the club described as a minor thigh injury. Obviously, after that, then it was revealed that Isak had asked the club to explore options away. ""It just kind of painted a picture that his head has been turned due to the interest from Liverpool. But Isak has his own team of trainers and physicians. And Eddie Howe has actually spoken about this before on the record and said the club are comfortable that Isak has got his own people. ""And that's why he's training with them. Yes,  it's out in the Basque region and not here in Newcastle. So I can see that the optics of that don't look great as far as the Newcastle United fans are concerned. ""But I do expect Isak back here in the North East next week when Newcastle return from South Korea. They come fly back on Monday. I expect him to be back. And then I guess he's going to have discussions with Howe, senior members of the staff here to decide what the next steps are for the Swedish international because nobody's come in from Liverpool as yet. ""And it's a bit of a waiting game. Newcastle, are trying to get a replacement if Isak was to go. Benjamin Sesko is a player they are very keen on.""",31/07/2025

Slot: Liverpool would never hesitate to sign someone if given the chance,"Liverpool head coach Arne Slot insisted the club would never hesitate to sign a player if the chance presented itself. Despite having spent close to £300 million already this summer, the Reds continue to be linked with Newcastle striker Alexander Isak in what would be a British transfer record deal. Sky Sports While the club have held an interest in the Sweden international for some time, there has been no approach but Isak’s decision to absent himself from Newcastle’s pre-season trip to South Korea has only increased speculation about a potential switch to Anfield. There has been a considerable turnover this summer with senior players Trent Alexander-Arnold and Luis Diaz departing, in addition to second-choice goalkeeper Caoimhin Kelleher, Jarell Quansah, Nat Phillips and Darwin Nunez – and Federico Chiesa expected to leave before the end of the window. The response has been to spend a club-record fee on Florian Wirtz, while also bringing in his Bayer Leverkusen team-mate Jeremie Frimpong, Eintracht Frankfurt’s Hugo Ekitike, Bournemouth defender Milos Kerkez and goalkeeper Giorgi Mamardashvili. But Slot said the spending may not stop there. “I always say, another thing about Liverpool is that if we see a chance in the market, we never hesitate to bring someone in,” he told reporters before departing Japan at the end of their trip to the Far East. “In the end it’s about quality and we have already made some very good signings. In terms of quality, we are already in the right place.”",31/07/2025

But speaking after Man Utd’s win over Bournemouth in the Summer Series, Ruben Amorim has given his backing to Rasmus Hojlund: “I'm really happy with Rasmus,"" said Amorim. ""I don't know what is going to happen until the end of the market.

Amorim: I'm really happy with Hojlund,"Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim says he's really happy with Rasmus Hojlund, after his goal and performance in his side's Premier League Summer Series win over Bournemouth. Hojlund opened the scoring as United beat the Cherries 4-1 in Chicago.

Mbeumo relishing chance to play with Bruno | 'Watkins a complete striker',"Manchester United’s new signing Bryan Mbeumo says he is excited about linking up with Bruno Fernandes after completing his move to Old Trafford. Cameroon winger Mbeumo, who scored 20 goals and provided seven assists for Brentford in the Premier League last season, signed a five-year contract last week to become United’s third summer signing. When asked on the Rio Ferdinand Presents podcast who he was most looking forward to playing alongside, Mbeumo told the former United defender: “Of course, Bruno. Of course, yeah. “Everyone sees in the past years. He can shoot, he can cross, he can do crazy ball. Yeah, for a striker, you just enjoy that.” Mbeumo is hoping to nurture a chemistry on and off the training pitch with United’s Portuguese talisman before the club launch the 2025-26 campaign at home against Arsenal on August 17. “I think it’s a little bit of everything. You earn experience from everyone. So it’s always good to speak to someone like this,” Mbeumo said. “But at the end, I think on the pitch, when you’re smart like he is, I think you don’t even need to think a lot. You just need to make the run and he’s going to play you in the right space every time. “But of course, you can have a little discussion to make him know how I prefer the balls and how I’m feeling the best to have the ball. “But at a certain point, there is only one way, even if it’s not the one you like, you have to do the run and he’s going to put the ball in a good position.” Mbeumo’s arrival at Old Trafford follows the signings of Wolves forward Matheus Cunha and Paraguay left-back Diego Leon, from Cerro Porteno. United have recently been linked with Ollie Watkins – RB Leipzig’s Benjamin Sesko is also a reported target – and Mbeumo described his former Brentford team-mate as the “complete striker”. Mbeumo said of Watkins: “I think he’s really complete. He’s like a complete striker. He can do a lot of things. “He can drop with the set or going in behind. And I think this is really good for me or for a winger because you can use his space to fit in there. And he can combine as well. So, I think it’s really good.”",29/07/2025

Guardiola hints at lengthy break after leaving Man City,"Pep Guardiola has reiterated his plan to take a break from football when he ends his time at Manchester City and suggested it could be for several years. Guardiola, 54, has been at City since 2016 but during last season’s slump in form he ended speculation over his immediate future by signing a new contract that runs until 2027. Speaking to GQ Spain, Guardiola said: “I know that after this stage with City I’m going to stop, that’s for sure. It’s decided, more than decided. “I don’t know how long I’ll stop for, a year, two years, three years, five, 10, 15, I don’t know. But I will leave after this spell with City because I need to stop and focus on myself.” Guardiola previously took a one-year break after leaving Barcelona and before taking charge at Bayern Munich. Last season was City’s first without a trophy since Guardiola’s first campaign in charge. When asked how he felt about City’s campaign being described as a “failure,” Guardiola said: “I’m delighted to have failed. “I love failures. In this society where everything has to be perfect, where you have to post your food on Instagram… ‘Oh, how good, how happy I am’. Everyday we have to prove that we’re happy. Well, yes, I’m sad, I fail and I lose. So? “Name one who doesn’t do it. The important thing is to give it your all and do it well. And I haven’t given up on that… Next year I’m going to do better. That’s what it’s all about.”",28/07/2025

Bayern’s priority is a left-winger rather than a right-winger, however, while Leverkusen boss Erik ten Hag – who signed him an £86m deal for United in 2022 – has been quoted in Germany saying “we are not interested at the moment”. Ten Hag also stated “we’ll see what happens in the future” – which may be an indication of the financial parameters set by United to buy him. Betis, where Antony thrived last season, cannot afford a permanent deal as things stand and are hoping for the chance to discuss another loan. United prefer a permanent sale but bids are yet to materialise and only Leverkusen and Betis are thought to have contacted with them so far. The interest from Saudi Arabia is thought to be increasing and Antony maybe open to exploring the idea, although he would prefer to remain in Europe. The winger rediscovered some of his best form on loan at Betis last season, scoring nine goals and making five more for team-mates in 26 appearances.",25/07/2025

"Young, physical, composed - Mosquera has talent to be honed","Sky Sports' Nick Wright: One of the best indicators of Cristhian Mosquera's quality can be found in the sheer number of minutes he has played. Since being drafted into the Valencia team at the age of 19 in August 2023, he has started 70 league games out of a possible 72. In probably the most challenging position on the pitch tactically, and with all the pressure of playing for one of the biggest clubs in Spain as they navigated a turbulent period, the young centre-back came to be seen as undroppable by two different managers. His total of 6,394 minutes played across the last two seasons is the highest by anyone aged 21 or under in Europe's top-five leagues. The volume of playing time highlights reliability and robustness. It also gave suitors such as Arsenal plenty to go on. Clearly they liked what they saw, and they were not the only ones, with Bayern Munich and RB Leipzig also said to have tracked him. He heads to Arsenal with a reputation as one of the the most promising young centre-backs in Europe... Sky Sports",24/07/2025

"Arteta impressed with Dowman, 15, but unsure on minutes","Mikel Arteta was very impressed with the impact of 15-year-old winger Max Dowman - but is unsure on how many first-team minutes he will get for Arsenal this season. The teenage midfielder was one of two 15-year-olds to make their first senior appearance in the 1-0 win over AC Milan, along with centre-back Marli Salmon. But Dowman stole the show with a promising cameo - and nearly got on the scoresheet. ""Yes, I'm very happy with all the kids,"" said Arteta when asked about Dowman. ""I think they are able to play at that level, with 15 years old, in my opinion, because of the environment, and the culture that is within the team, and when somebody makes you feel so comfortable, so confident, straight away you can go and do it. ""Obviously it gives you the best chance, you have to have the qualities that this kid has. ""We don't know [about Dowman's minutes this season]. With all the young kids at the end, they are in and around the team constantly, and they are really used to the dynamics, the demands, and especially raising the physical levels. ""Because the demands, and actually to be able to perform and impact the game at that level, it demands really, really high physical standards, and they are getting that, and that gives them another platform, and then they will have to earn it.""",24/07/2025

'Rashford may have found his calling at Barca',"Sky Sports News reporter Gary Cotterill in Barcelona: As we know, Barcelona is more than a club. On his big day at the Nou Camp, Marcus Rashford was more than impressive. Smiling. Suited and booted, and his answers to dozens of questions were tailor made. Tailor made to look forward, not back. There were journalists who'd travelled from England to be here, me included. All of them were trying to catch the eye of the Barcelona press officer, but none were allowed a question. The feeling being that local reporters would ask about Barcelona, not Manchester United. And that's how it turned out. The club's new no. 14 said everything a Barcelona fan would want to hear about the place where 'dreams come true'. When he was finally asked one solitary question about his parent club, he controlled it beautifully, turned on a sixpence (our euro) and hammered it into the top of the net. ""I've nothing bad to say,"" he said. 1-0 to the media chiefs. The only slight hiccup Rashford made all day was timekeeping. He arrived 15 minutes late for the contract signing ceremony, but no one seemed to mind. The first Englishman to play for Barcelona since Gary Lineker posed near an old English telephone box as part of his official club video. Apt. Because at his media unveiling Marcus Rashford Rang the right tone and kept everyone engaged. He may well have found his calling.",23/07/2025

Ekitike could become a bargain,"Analysis by Sky Sports' Adam Bate: Hugo Ekitike is a multi-functional centre-forward who can operate as a No.9 but has the ability to fulfil other roles too. As such, Liverpool feel they are signing a high-performing player who is capable of justifying this price tag - and with huge potential to improve. Much has been made of the similarity between the French forward and Alexander Isak, the Newcastle striker who would have been many clubs' top target this summer had it not been for the prohibitive costs of the deal. Ekitike matches up on many metrics. In fact, the numbers suggest that he brings others into play even more, a team player who makes intelligent runs with and without the ball. Ekitike can stretch defences by attacking the space in behind on transition but is also creative operating in tight spaces. Critics might point to Isak's superior scoring record - Ekitike registered 15 goals in the Bundesliga last season - but Liverpool may well regard the underlying numbers as more encouraging and evidence that Ekitike could even be undervalued in the current market. Data experts would take the view that Ekitike's expected-goals figure, which was among the highest in the Bundesliga last season, proves that he is a player whose physicality and intelligent movement sees him arrive in good situations time and time again. Such numbers tend to regress to the mean. The club would prefer to invest in a player whose numbers are likely to trend upwards. If Ekitike can do that then - even at an initial price of £69m - Liverpool could come to see their investment in him as a bargain",23/07/2025

Sky Germany have reported that the Turkish club are confident of a deal with City and that personal terms are verbally agreed with the player’s agent. But City have not yet had any approach from Galatasaray, and they do not want their No.1 ‘keeper to leave. Ederson said publicly during their pre-season tour that “my future is here"" at City and that, at the time, reports of a move away were “99% fake news”. He said: ""My head is here. It stays with the City. It gives me everything to go back to the Premier League again and try to win the Champions League as well. My mind is staying in the club."" Manager Pep Guardiola has always said if a player asks to leave he would not stand in their way – so it would be up to Ederson to tell the club if those are now his wishes. City remain in talks over the potential re-signing of Burnley goalkeeper James Trafford amid uncertainty over both Ederson and Stefan Ortega’s futures. City have a £40m buy-back clause in his contract after selling him to Burnley in 2023, however they are negotiating on that price.

Arsenal's Zubimendi explains Liverpool U-turn,"New Arsenal midfielder Martin Zubimendi has opened up on why he turned down Liverpool last summer. The Spaniard moved to Mikel Arteta's Gunners in a £51m deal this summer but was close to joining Arne Slot's Reds a year ago - only to decide to stay at Real Sociedad. Arsenal also approached La Real over the midfielder last summer but ended up signing Mikel Merino instead, with the promise to come back for Zubimendi a year later. Sky Sports News also understands Arsenal manager Arteta had a major role in Zubimendi picking the north London club. Speaking from Arsenal's pre-season tour in Singapore, Zubimendi told reporters: “The first question I had to answer was whether I wanted to stay at Sociedad. It wasn't the right time [to leave last summer]. “I saw that Sociedad was still a step forward for me and the things I had to give were important. So the best thing for me was to stay.” Asked about the impact of Arteta, “I don't know what he saw in me but what I saw in him is that he's a top coach in Europe. “When I wanted to leave I wanted a quality coach. I've seen how obsessive and detailed he is with his game so I think I've found the right one. “It's a change for me. It's the change I wanted. And since the first day I've been here I've noticed the greatness of this club and I'm adapting.”",23/07/2025

Man Utd keeping an eye on Jackson,"Latest from Sky Sports News' Kaveh Solhekol: Manchester United are understood to be keeping an eye on Chelsea striker Nicolas Jackson. Chelsea value the forward between £80 and £100m with  number of Premier League clubs and clubs in Europe and Saudi Arabia interested in signing him this summer. Chelsea are under no pressure to sell as he has eight years left on his contract. If he was to leave, the £79m Liverpool are paying for Hugo Eikitike would be used as a benchmark for any potential deal. Jackson has a better scoring and goal involvement record over the past two seasons in a higher standard league. Meanwhile, any incomings at Chelsea continue to be exit dependent. Chelsea would ideally like to start the season with three high-quality players who can play in the No. 9 role. They have signed Liam Delap and Joao Pedro this summer. If Jackson was to leave, they may sign a wide player instead of another No. 9 because Pedro Neto can also play through the middle. Xavi Simons, Alejandro Garnacho, Morgan Rogers and Kenan Yildiz are some of the players Chelsea are currently looking at.",22/07/2025

Sky Sports News has been told the issue is not football or transfer-related and was communicated by the midfielder internally. We understand the club are happy to respect his privacy and Forest have made no public comment on the matter.

How can Liverpool afford Ekitike after signing Wirtz?,"How can Liverpool afford Hugo Ekitike having already spent a club-record fee to bring Florian Wirtz to Anfield earlier this summer? Well, the club's financial records indicated they could potentially lose a further £200m this summer and still be compliant with Profit & Sustainability Rules (PSR) - where clubs are permitted to lose £105m over a three-year period. According to football finance expert Swiss Ramble, the Reds' most recent financial results showed Liverpool have actually made £48m in the current three-year PSR period, partly due to modest recent transfer spend. That means Liverpool can lose a further £158m and still be compliant next summer. And while Liverpool have already spent around £185m on new players in the current window - including a fee of up to £116m for Wirtz - the Reds posted a club record revenue of £613.8m for the 2023-24 season, partly due to commercial success. That figure will only increase on the 2024-25 season accounts given Liverpool added Champions League football, knockout qualification for that tournament and also became Premier League champions. Academy product Jarell Quansah has already joined Bayer Leverkusen in a £35m deal that represents 100 per cent profit under PSR rules, and the Reds could further boost sales figures by the end of the summer. And earlier in the summer, Brentford signed backup Reds goalkeeper Caoimhin Kelleher for an initial £12.5m. Darwin Nunez, Harvey Elliott and Luiz Diaz are all further potential departures, although a Diaz exit is currently less likely despite Bayern Munich's attempts to prise him away.",21/07/2025

Howe: Summer has not gone to plan so far,"Newcastle manager Eddie Howe admitted his summer had not gone to plan after experiencing some frustration in the transfer market following the shock departure of sporting director Paul Mitchell. News of Mitchell’s departure came in late May while Howe was on holiday and immediately gave him added responsibilities. Since then the Carabao Cup winners have only added winger Anthony Elanga to their first-team squad – Spain Under-19 international Antonio Cordero is expected to go out on loan after arriving from Malaga. Howe is looking to strengthen after seeing Callum Wilson reject a new contract offer and reluctantly selling Lloyd Kelly to Juventus and Sean Longstaff to Leeds in a bid to manage financial fair play regulations. The Newcastle manager is also managing transfer speculation around Alexander Isak, who was allowed to go home and shield from the scrutiny following an Austrian training camp, while the rest of the squad were at Celtic Park for a 4-0 pre-season friendly defeat on Saturday. And being at the sharp end of the recruitment process has underlined the difficulties of attracting top players to St James’ Park. Newcastle appear to have lost a transfer battle with Liverpool who look set to finalise a deal for Eintracht Frankfurt striker Hugo Ekitike. Howe said: “My wish was for us to do our business early and we certainly tried, but it wasn’t to be. “We’ve had a frustrating time in terms of losing targets to other clubs. I’d be very open with that. That’s happened on several occasions. “You just have to accept it. In order for a transfer to really work, in my opinion, the player has to be desperate to come to your club. If we don’t get that, the transfer doesn’t work. “We’re seeking players that are good enough, that are desperate to come, and that can make the difference that they’re in short supply for us. “We’re confident that we can try and get some more players in to strengthen the depth of the squad. We’re certainly aware that we need to and we’re trying as hard as we can to do that.”",20/07/2025

Tomiyasu explains Arsenal exit,"Takehiro Tomiyasu has opened up on the circumstances behind his early exit from Arsenal after agreeing to leave the club 12 months before the end of his contract. He told DAZN Japan: “It wasn’t a sudden decision to leave. First of all, I want to make it clear that my contract wasn’t terminated unilaterally, and I didn’t unilaterally say: ‘I’m leaving’. “We had a proper discussion and came to the conclusion that: ‘This decision is best for me, for the club, and for everyone’. So I’m leaving. It all ended amicably. “From my perspective, it’s the best timing. I’ll be free, and most importantly, the most positive thing about this decision is that it will allow me to focus on my rehabilitation and on myself. “I was there for four years, but I only played five minutes in the 2024-25 season, and I spent a whole year in rehabilitation. I was under a lot of stress and anxiety. To be honest, I wasn’t feeling like I was there anymore, and I was wondering: ‘Is this where my future is?’”",19/07/2025

'Madueke's versatility important for Arsenal',"Sky Sports News' Mark McAdam on The Transfer Show: ""One of the key things we do know, and one of the reasons Arsenal targeted Noni Madueke, is his versatility.

""Sporting director Andrea Berta has been a big fan of his for some time and he was a driving force in getting the deal over the line. ""He's a right-sided player with a left foot. While Bukayo Saka was injured for a chunk of last season, Arsenal lost that spark he brought to the side and now they've brought someone in who can, essentially, play, but also provide that something different if Saka were to get injured. ""When you look at the stats from last season, he was effective. He and Mohammed Kudus had similar price tags, then when you look at his output, he scored two more goals and created more chances.

Sargent's goal return goes under the radar,"Analysis by Sky Sports' Dan Long: Josh Sargent only played in 55 of Norwich's 92 Championship games over the last two seasons, meaning a superb return of 31 goals in that time - an average of more than one every other game - has perhaps gone under the radar. In fact, only Joel Piroe (52) has scored more goals in the second tier than Sargent's 44 since the start of 2022/23. The USA international has proved himself to be a consistent goal threat - and would surely have been keen for another crack at the Premier League. In 2021/22, he scored twice in 26 appearances for the Canaries, but he's 25 now and far better prepared.",18/07/2025

'Wissa's price tag may have gone up after Mbeumo deal',"Sky Sports News' Mark McAdam on The Transfer Show: ""You'd imagine that, off the back of losing someone like Bryan Mbeumo, there would be a reluctance to sell any more players. ""However, while the stance from Brentford is Yoane Wissa is not for sale, when you're talking transfers, you always have to caveat it with, if someone puts this amount of money on the table, they may find it difficult to resist. ""We know there is a lot of interest in Wissa. We know Nottingham Forest failed with bids in January and earlier this summer; we know there is interest from Tottenham and Newcastle. ""But, so far, Brentford have been able to resist any potential offers from these clubs. ""He has one year, plus a club option for a further year, on his contract, which gives them a slight advantage in this situation. ""You can understand why Brentford say they don't want to sell all of their star players; they know that could be leaving us in a perilous position to do that. ""Therefore, the price tag may have just gone up a little bit from what it was this time last week.""",18/07/2025

'Madueke versatility a big factor behind Arsenal interest',"Latest from Sky Sports News' Dharmesh Sheth: Arsenal's sporting director Andrea Berta is understood to have led the negotiations for Noni Madueke's signing, while Mikel Arteta played a key role in talks with the player. Madueke's versatility as a winger was a big factor behind Arsenal's desire to move for him. The England international brings plenty of experience despite being just 23 years old, having made over 170 club appearances so far in his career. Given Arsenal's injury problems last season, Madueke's availability as a regular starter in his time at Chelsea was viewed favourably by Arsenal's recruitment team. Madueke made 92 appearances for the west London club after joining from PSV in January 2023 and last season started in 27 of Chelsea's Premier League matches. The former Spurs academy graduate is returning to north London where he grew up and already has strong relationships with a number of players at Arsenal. Sky Sports",18/07/2025

It is thought there would have to be departures at Juve to fund a move for Sancho, and both Timothy Weah and Nico Gonzalez could leave the club. Marseille are in talks to sign Weah, who turned down Nottingham Forest earlier in the summer, while Atletico Madrid and Inter are both interested in the Argentina international Gonzalez. Juve have been interested in Sancho throughout the summer window so far and United him at £25m – and they are now also having a look at Rashford amid uncertainty over the future of Dusan Vlahovic. Juve’s priority at centre-forward has been the return of Randal Kolo Muani but if Vlahovic leaves, the club may look to sign another striker and they have been asking for information about Rashford. Rashford’s priority has been a move to Barcelona, who have stepped up their interest after failing with Nico Williams or Luis Diaz. However, no offer has yet arrived from Barca despite him emerging as their primary left-wing target. Inter have also been mentioned with Sancho in the last 24 hours, but only if they are unable to sign Ademola Lookman, while Napoli had been interested in earlier in the window.",17/07/2025
Arsenal complete world-record Smith deal,"Arsenal Women have signed striker Olivia Smith from Liverpool Women for a world-record fee of £1m. The 20-year-old becomes the first women's player to surpass the seven-figure barrier, eclipsing the £900,000 ($1.1m) Chelsea paid San Diego Wave for Naiomi Girma in January. Smith played in 20 WSL games last season, scoring seven of Liverpool's 22 goals as they finished seventh in the league. The Reds paid a club-record £210,000 to sign Smith from Sporting CP last summer, meaning they have made a profit of just under £800,000. Sky Sports",17/07/2025

"Isak, Hugo Ekitike, Newcastle and Liverpool - it's complicated, and that's even without Man Utd","The latest from the backpages on what is currently proving to be the biggest transfer talking point of the summer so far... As The Times says, the picture around Newcastle, Liverpool, Alexander Isak and Hugo Ekitike is 'complicated'. The tug-of-war is branded just that by The Telegraph with Newcastle and Liverpool headlined as 'going to war' for Ekitike. 'Newcastle United are pushing ahead with their attempt to sign Eintracht Frankfurt striker Hugo Ekitike in the hope of pairing him with Alexander Isak next season,' The Telegraph reports. The Times, though, is still dangling the Isak option for Liverpool. The Sweden striker is described as Liverpool's 'first choice' and Liverpool sources are cited as 'insisting that the club are assessing all options'. Does that mean they haven't given up on Isak? And that's not all. Ready for one more curveball? According to Florian Plettenberg of Sky Germany, not only are Liverpool willing to pay more for Ekitike than Newcastle have currently offered, but there's another club on the scene too... 'Manchester United are also still involved and are monitoring the situation closely.' Goodness.",17/07/2025

Is there more to Isak-Ekitike talk than meets the eye?,"Sky Sports News' Dharmesh Sheth on The Transfer Show: ""If we just take this on face value, Alexander Isak is of interest to Liverpool. Newcastle have said Isak is not for sale. ""Hugo Ekitike is a player that Liverpool and Newcastle are both interested in. So, at face value, fine. We don't need to worry about Isak anymore because he's not for sale. So clearly that story's gone. ""But we do know that when a club is interested in a player, then somewhere along the line, there must have been some sort of encouragement. ""I'm not saying that's happened in this case, but usually if a club approaches another club, it is because somewhere along the line, there has been some sort of encouragement. ""Newcastle hold the cards here. Isak has got three years left on his contract. They don't have to sell. They've got a player under contract. They're paying him good money. ""He hasn't gone physically up to Newcastle and said 'I want to go'. And even if he did, Newcastle don't have to do anything because he's under contract. ""But this interest in Isak and the subsequent noise around Ekitike poses the question, is there more to these two deals than meets the eye? ""Do they want him to play alongside Isak next season? Or is he looked at as a replacement for Isak either next season or further along the line, maybe next summer if Isak is eventually to leave Newcastle? ""Liverpool conveniently now are interested in Ekotike as well. They are told by Newcastle Isak's not for sale and they're now pursuing Newcastle's No 1 target. Coincidence? Maybe. ""Otherwise, the cynic in every one of us thinks something else is going on here.""",16/07/2025

And according to The Daily Mail, 'Liverpool are prepared to smash their transfer record' on Isak and 'they will move if they receive encouragement.' The Mail adds that while Liverpool are targeting Isak, they have a number of other candidates under discussion, including Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins, Brentford's Yoane Wissa, Victor Osimhen and, wait for it, Marcus Rashford. Elsewhere, The Guardian say that although Liverpool are 'in the market' for a centre-forward and Isak is 'high on their list', the Reds 'expect Isak to remain on Tyneside.' The Telegraph, meanwhile, have a slightly different take. According to them, Liverpool 'would not have made first move for British record £120m transfer without encouragement.' Sky Sports",16/07/2025

Celtic searching for Tierney cover,"Sky Sports News' Anthony Joseph: Celtic may have brought in club legend Kieran Tierney as their first-choice left-back – but they need cover. Greg Taylor left Glasgow for Greece earlier this month, when he joined PAOK after his contract expired. It’s pretty clear, going by the last few seasons, that Tierney is not going to be able to play 60-odd matches this season, so the Hoops are looking for someone to job-share the role with him. Celtic know it is not an easy sell to go in the market for a second-choice left-back, but whoever they bring in will get a decent amount of game time. At the moment it looks like the Hoops are searching for a young player to fill that role and develop. But if they can’t secure that, they may have to go with a more experienced option, or a loan. In February, Celtic brought in 32-year-old Jeffrey Schlupp on loan from Crystal Palace when Alex Valle left for Como. Schlupp is now a free agent and still without a club.",15/07/2025

Analysis: Ekitike is another Isak in the making,"Sky Sports' Sam Blitz: Alexander Isak’s strike partner? His replacement at St James’ Park? Or Liverpool’s back-up option for the Newcastle forward? Which one will it be for Hugo Ekitike? The 23-year-old is commanding a huge £85m transfer fee and the German club know what they are doing. They are fully aware that Ekitike has the potential to be one of the top No 9s in Europe – they do not want the forward’s sale to look cheap in a few years’ time. Parallels can be drawn to the £63m club record fee Newcastle paid for Isak. It looked like an expensive deal for the then-Real Sociedad striker at the time – but certainly looks like a good piece of business for the Magpies now. If the reports are to be believed, Isak is now worth at least double that. That is not the only comparison between the two forwards – as everything points towards Isak being another Ekitike in the making. Stylistically, the two players are identical in terms of being a shot-heavy forward, but also capable of creating chances and laying on assists. And in many metrics, Ekitike went at a better attacking rate in the Bundesliga last season than Isak did in the Premier League. The near-identical numbers between the two not only shows why Newcastle are lining up Ekitike, but why Liverpool can turn to the Frankfurt striker as an alternative if their Isak pursuit, as is expected, proves unfruitful. At least one of these strikers will move around, but the only question is where?",15/07/2025
'Eze the x-factor Arsenal need',"Sky Sports' Paul Merson believes Eberechi Eze would be the perfect signing for Arsenal this summer. Crystal Palace's Eze is one of a number of forwards Arsenal have an interest in this summer.

""If you asked me whether Arsenal should sign Eberechi Eze or Noni Madueke, I'd have said Eze all day long,"" Merson said. ""Now that's a deal I can see happening and it would be a brilliant signing for Arsenal. He's perfect. Speaking to Sky Sports, former Gunner Merson added: ""Arsenal struggle when teams come to the Emirates and put everyone behind the ball. Teams want to limit the space Arsenal have to play in and they have struggled to break teams down with those tactics. ""For me, that's where Eze comes in. He's got the X-factor and the ability to break a low block down. ""Away from home, maybe he's not the answer. Against the likes of Liverpool and Man City, they may come under the cosh for a bit, and they may have to play slightly differently. ""But that's why you have a big squad. At home, against the lesser teams, where they have 70 to 80 per cent of the ball, let Eze go and do what he wants because he will make something happen.

Liverpool reject Bayern's £58.5m bid for Diaz,"Latest from Sky Sports News' Lyall Thomas: Liverpool have rejected Bayern Munich’s first official offer for Luis Diaz. The bid is believed to be worth £58.5m – and the club have turned it down outright. Sky Sports News exclusively revealed on July 2 that Liverpool had told Bayern that Diaz is not for sale. Nevertheless, Bayern believe Diaz is keen to join them and have returned with a first official bid, but it remains to be seen whether Bayern return with another offer.

Mbeumo and Wissa return to training amid transfer interest,"Latest from Sky Sports News' Lyall Thomas: Bryan Mbeumo and Yoane Wissa returned to Brentford today to begin pre-season training with both their futures on the line. The duo were always due to return today along with the other senior international players in the squad, such as Mikel Damsgaard. Mbeumo and Wissa's futures seemingly hinge on each other's, with Brentford high unlikely to sanction the sale of both players. Doing so would be considered such a significant loss of goals and attacking threat that it would be nearly impossible for the club to recover via the transfer market. And, in a summer of significant change already that has seen manager Thomas Frank join Tottenham and their captain Christian Norgaard join Arsenal, selling both Mbeumo and Wissa as well is seen as a risk too significant to take. It means whichever club agrees a deal for either of them first would almost certainly scupper a move for the other - with both players having a year left plus an option year on their contracts. Manchester United have been in talks with Brentford for Mbeumo for some time but there remains in a gap in their respective valuations of the Cameroon international. United’s offer of a £55m fixed fee plus £7.5m in add-ons falls short of the £65m that Brentford want, of which most, if not all, must be paid up-front. Congo forward Wissa, meanwhile, is the subject of a rejected bid from Nottingham Forest and he is also of interest to Newcastle and Spurs. He is valued north of £40m.",14/07/2025

Jackson's Chelsea future 'uncertain' amid interest from multiple clubs,"Latest from Sky Sports News' Kaveh Solhekol: Chelsea have already been active in the transfer market this summer, signing Liam Delap, Joao Pedro and Jamie Gittens but any more incomings are likely to depend on exits. Noni Madueke and Djordje Petrovic have been sold and there remain question marks over the future of Nicolas Jackson. Pedro and Delap appear to be ahead of Jackson now for the role of central striker, but Chelsea are not actively trying to sell any of their players. There continues to be interest in Jackson from multiple clubs, especially as strikers are in demand and short supply this summer. At the moment. Jackson is staying but that is not guaranteed to be the case by the time the window closes. In an ideal world, Chelsea would like to start next season with three high-quality forwards who can play the No. 9 role and if Jackson does leave, they have the option of playing Pedro Neto centrally and signing another wide player. Meanwhile, Robert Sanchez is in the form of his life and he will fight it out for the No. 1 shirt with Filip Jorgensen next season. Chelsea asked AC Milan about the availability of Mike Maignan last month but no deal materialised and they are unlikely to sign a goalkeeper this summer. Sanchez pulled off some spectacular saves in the Club World Cup final and he won the tournament award for best goalkeeper. If his form continues on an upward trajectory and his ability to play out from the back reliably and consistent carries on improving, then he will be Chelsea’s No. 1. Meanwhile, the 19-year-old Belgian goalkeeper is expected to join Strasbourg on loan.",14/07/2025

McAtee's future is uncertain with a year left, and Bayer Leverkusen have been expected to advance their interest after he played for England U21s at the Euros, although that is yet to materialise. The forward, who scored seven goals in 27 City appearances last season, has some Premier League suitors and he is understood to be open to leaving the Etihad in search of regular first-team games. Contrary to reports, City value McAtee beyond  the £25m-mark. While they have not put a specific figure on him, they would have cause to point towards the £40m they got for Cole Palmer as a guide. As another academy product, McAtee has actually played more first-team games for City than Palmer had before he signed for Chelsea and has also had a year in the Premier League with Sheffield United. In total, the 22-year-old McAtee has 48 Premier League appearances to his name and six in the Champions League. He got two assists and a goal to help inspire England's U21s to their Euros triumph last month.",09/07/2025
Newcastle will feel like the perfect step up for a goal-driven Elanga,"Analysis by Sky Sports' William Bitibiri: ""Having spent time watching Anthony Elanga's pre-season preparations ahead of last campaign, it was clear that ambition was oozing out of him, like the sweat from his brow after being put through his paces by his personal strength and conditioning coach, Tom Joyce. ""It was in those very sessions where he prepared for his most productive season with 18 goal contributions in 43 appearances across all competitions. It's in his final ball where Elanga added a further dimension to his game ""Goals, while admitting they played a big part in his development, during and after life at Manchester United, were kept personal, but the desire to improve on his previous year was loud. ""The 23-year-old turned into the embodiment of Nottingham Forest's threat on the counter, punishing sides as Forest narrowly missed out on Champions League qualification. ""Elanga added a new dimension to his game at the City Ground, with his creative return of 11 league assists, building on nine from the previous campaign. ""He'll have eyes on further developing this area as he prepares to link up with his Swedish compatriot, and key marksman, Alexander Isak, at St James' Park. ""His former club, United, may, or may not have foreseen the impact Elanga could have on, but they may rue Carrington-grown talent they let leave in 2023. However, Elanga's decision to depart will not be one he will regret, though, as he gears up for Champions League football on the Toon.""",09/07/2025

Is Madueke the answer to Arsenal's LW search?,"Sky Sports' Sam Blitz: Arsenal's pursuit of Noni Madueke has been a surprise - and a significant transfer fee put towards the Chelsea winger would split opinion in the Gunners fanbase. Arsenal are looking for a new winger to refresh their wide options but many expected the No 1 target to be Real Madrid's Rodrygo or Athletic Bilbao's Nico Williams. Both have the status and talent to match what Bukayo Saka does on the opposite flank. As a right-winger, Madueke would provide the Gunners with suitable cover for Saka - but is he the answer for Arsenal as a first-choice left winger? The 23-year-old played most of last season on the right but it is worth noting that eight out of his last nine appearances for club and country have come on the left wing. In his seven starts for Chelsea on the left last term, Madueke failed to get a goal, an assist or create a big chance in any of them. Looking at the numbers and his overall play, he seems more comfortable on the right. However, it is worth noting that Chelsea did win six of those seven games where Madueke started on the left - the only defeat was the 2-0 loss at Newcastle, where Nicolas Jackson was sent off and Madueke was sacrificed at half-time. Madueke did get an assist for England's winner against Andorra after starting on the left wing. But is Madueke going to significantly improve Arsenal's options in that position , even though he may be cheaper than a Rodrygo? Arsenal fans, what do you think?

Rohl planning to return to Wednesday this week,"Latest from Sky Sports News' Rob Dorsett: Danny Rohl is planning to return to Sheffield Wednesday later this week, after he missed the first two weeks of pre-season training. Rohl has stayed away, following a rift with owner Dejphon Chansiri and ongoing financial problems at the club. Wednesday were issued with a third transfer embargo from the EFL last week, after a second successive month where the players’ wages were not paid. But it seems Rohl has now had a change of heart, following positive news about the likelihood of Chansiri finding new owners to take over the club. The German coach has been linked with a host of other jobs - most recently, that at Leicester City, who had him on their shortlist of candidates to replace Ruud Van Nistelrooy. But Leicester decided not to progress their interest in Rohl, partly because of the complexity of the financial situation and Rohl’s contractual circumstances at Hillsborough.

Chelsea's need to balance books has opened door for Madueke Arsenal move,"Sky Sports News chief correspondent Kaveh Solhekol: ""We've been telling you for the past couple of weeks that there were question marks about Madueke's future at Chelsea and we've also been telling you that Arsenal are very, very interested in signing him. Arsenal have now made their move to sign him. ""I think it's a bit of a complicated situation regarding Madueke because he's played well for Chelsea since they signed him two and a half years ago from PSV Eindhoven for £29m. But it's been well documented that Chelsea have spent a lot of money in the transfer window already this summer and they need to balance their books. ""Last week they came to an agreement with UEFA that basically said that if they want to register new players for the Champions League next season, they have to make sure that their transfer spend this season is balanced out this summer by the players they sell as well. So they've signed players like Liam Delap and Joao Pedro. That means they also have to sell players. ""When clubs like Arsenal ring them up asking about Noni Madueke, I think Chelsea's position has to be that players are not officially for sale, but obviously if you want to put in an offer, put in an offer and we will judge it on its merits. ""I get the feeling that Noni Madueke is going to be an Arsenal player this summer. The timing probably is not great for Chelsea because they're on a high after winning their semi-final at the Club World Cup. They're preparing for the final on Sunday against PSG or Real Madrid. ""To be fair to Noni Madueke, and this is a point that Enzo Maresca has made out here in the US, he's got his head straight even though there's all this speculation swirling around about his future and the fact that he may well be an Arsenal player. He still performed for Chelsea when he's been called upon. ""He came on as a second-half substitute on Tuesday against Fluminense. He came on as a second-half substitute in the quarter-final against Palmeiras and played very, very well. So to be fair to him, he's not letting all these reports affect him, but I get the feeling that his days at Chelsea are numbered because they need to balance their books.""",09/07/2025

Spurs remain interested in Wissa,"Latest from Sky Sports News' Dharmesh Sheth and Lyall Thomas: Tottenham Hotspur remain interested in Brentford’s Yoane Wissa this summer. The Congo forward was of interest to them in January and that has been maintained throughout this year. Brentford are aware of it – but there has been no contact yet between the clubs. However, it is understood Spurs have been exploring the conditions of a potential deal. Brentford would be unlikely to sell both Wissa and Manchester United target Bryan Mbeumo.

Tottenham held initial talks about a deal for Mbeumo themselves around the time they hired Brentford’s head coach Thomas Frank. Mbeumo wants to move to Manchester United, however, and talks did not progress. Wissa would cost noticeably less than £65m-rated Mbeumo, with just year remaining on his contract.

Joao Pedro already paying off price tag,"Sky Sports' Adam Bate: Chelsea had already made almost £60m in participation and prize money for reaching the semi-final stage of the tournament and they made another £22m with their 2-0 win over Fluminense in the Club World Cup semi-final on Wednesday. Another £29m is on the line in the final at the weekend. In other words, Joao Pedro has swiftly paid off a chunk of his fee with his outrageous full debut. Chelsea's new signing had not scored from outside the box in 70 games for his previous club Brighton, but it took him just 18 minutes to curl the ball home here. If that effort showed his class, his second-half strike highlighted other assets - his ability as a ball carrier on the counter-attack, his dribbling threat and the power of his shooting. It was an emphatic finish by the Brazilian to all but end Fluminense's hopes. Nicolas Jackson carried the weight of responsibility to lead the line for Chelsea last season but with Liam Delap making an encouraging start to his career with the club, this performance from Joao Pedro offered further proof that the Blues have strengthened. His fluid movement makes him a different proposition and he even contributed at the other end of the pitch with a crucial defensive header late in the first half. He did not celebrate against former club Fluminense. But there will be many celebrations to come.",09/07/2025

Shankland pens three-year Hearts deal,"Hearts have announced that captain Lawrence Shankland has re-signed with the club on a three-year contract. The 29-year-old Scotland forward – who has scored 68 goals since arriving from Belgian side Beerschot three years ago – looked to be on his way out of Tynecastle after several rounds of negotiations over the past 18 months failed to result in an agreement However, after becoming a free agent this summer and exploring his options, Shankland has been persuaded by recently-installed manager Derek McInnes to accept an offer to become the club’s highest-paid player. The striker flew out to Spain on Wednesday evening to meet up with the Hearts squad at their pre-season training base and the Jambos announced on Thursday afternoon that he has agreed a deal until 2028, bringing to an end a long-running contract saga. “Lawrence’s not only been ingrained in the club the last few years, he’s been a big player for the club, knows his way about the Premiership, knows his way to goal,” McInnes told the Hearts website. “It just made so much sense on so many levels for me. I’ve known Lawrence since he was a young boy and I know how important family is to him and how important being happy is. “I always felt that that was a huge advantage for us. Not only does he enjoy his time at Hearts, those family connections are always very strong.” Shankland marked his first campaign at the club by becoming the first Hearts player in 31 years to score more than 20 goals in a season and then netted 31 goals in 2023-24 to earn himself every Scottish Premiership Player of the Year award available and secure a place in the Scotland squad for Euro 2024. The former Ayr and Dundee United forward’s most recent campaign was more of a struggle in front of goal and he incurred the wrath of some fans after a costly Conference League penalty miss away to Cercle Brugge in November, although he did notch five times in his final five appearances to leave supporters clinging to the hope that he might decide to remain at Tynecastle. The retention of their most prolific forward of the 21st century represents a significant coup at a time when Hearts are embarking on an exciting new era in partnership with Jamestown Analytics and with Brighton owner Tony Bloom on board as a minority investor. “I do feel that having that recognised number no.9, a goal scorer with a real pedigree, Scotland internationalist, the motivation for Lawrence to do well here at not only a club that he loves, a club that he’s happy with,” added McInnes. “You see the way he’s embraced his team-mates this morning. He’s a really popular boy, but he’s got so much to do here. In my time at Hearts, I want to make sure it’s successful and I want Lawrence to feel exactly the same and he does. “We want to be lifting silverware. We want to be going into group stages in Europe and we want to have a consistent thing going here and that is the driver for all of us. I do feel that having Lawrence in the building gives us a better chance of achieving all that.”",03/07/2025
Fernandez ‘can’t be more grateful’ after signing for Rangers,"New Rangers signing Emmanuel Fernandez has revealed how he had to dig deep to revive his dream of a career in professional football.

But Fernandez recalled being placed in limbo in 2020 when he was released by Gillingham as a teenager and signed for non-league Ramsgate before Peterborough eventually offered him a route back into league football in 2021. “My journey from being let go by a club, playing non-league during the Covid season, not really having a club and then obviously getting an opportunity at Peterborough, where it took me a while to start playing, but eventually I played and after fully playing [last season], to get this move, I can’t be more grateful,” he said in an interview with Rangers TV. “I think it was my family behind me, pushing me and making sure they kept me on the right tracks to train harder. If I didn’t have a club, train and just push myself to the next level because during Covid you couldn’t really do much. But I’d go to the park, do runs sometimes, bring my brother along with me, so that’s what pushed me to get to this point in my career.""",03/07/2025

Taylor dismisses speculation that Tierney return influenced move,"Greg Taylor has dismissed the notion that the return of fellow left-back Kieran Tierney this summer effectively forced him out of Celtic after his move to Greek side PAOK. “I would certainly not say that’s fair,” Taylor said in an interview with Sky Sports News. “I think there’s been competition for my place at Celtic in the whole six years I was there and it was not something I ever shirked from. “I loved that, it drove me on, it helped me find my best level so, no, I wouldn’t say it was particularly Kieran coming back. It was just that I felt that it was probably the right time for me to try something different.” Taylor, who won 11 trophies and made more than 200 appearances for Celtic, said leaving Parkhead was “the biggest decision” of his career. “When I left Kilmarnock back in 2019 it was that bit easier because I was progressing,” he said. “I wanted to go and try and play for the biggest team in Scotland and I think at that time there probably weren’t many who believed I would play as many games as I did but the one person that really did was myself. “I was lucky to go and play 200-plus games for Celtic which was unbelievable. It wasn’t easy, there was a million things to weigh up but I just felt it was the right time to do it.”",03/07/2025

Richarlison to be assessed before decision on Spurs future,"Latest from Sky Sports News' Lyall Thomas: Richarlison is among the players Thomas Frank will assess in pre-season before a decision is made on his Tottenham future. The Brazil striker has been the subject of wide speculation in successive transfer windows, in part down to injuries hampering his ability to play regular football. His preference remains to stay and fight for his place at Spurs, conscious he has not been able to show his best because of those periods on the sidelines. But Galatasaray are thought to be among a number of teams who would be interested in signing him if there is any sign he could leave this summer. The Turkish club may be more interested in the scenario of a loan, as would several other clubs, although that is far away from being a possibility at this stage. Among Richarlison's priorities is to ensure he is the regular Brazil No9 and for that he needs to play regularly at a high level. He still has two years left on his contract at Spurs, who will play Champions League football next season and therefore need the strength in-depth.
