""I think he feels more comfortable because he plays in the centre, he doesn't need to go to the side so much. I'm really pleased [with him]. ""I think he's not young, but he can learn a lot. He can improve. I think he can be so much better with the ball. Because he has that quality and he needs to show that. ""Nowadays, with the set-pieces that you see, the amount of men that you put in the box, every cross from the opponents and everyone is playing like that.

Rashford makes it clear he wants to stay at Barcelona,"Marcus Rashford has made it clear he wants to stay at Barcelona as he gears up for his first El Clasico against Real Madrid this weekend. Rashford moved to Barcelona on loan from Manchester United this summer and the LaLiga giants have the option of making the deal permanent next year. Having scored five goals in 12 games including a double in the midweek Champions League thrashing of Olympiacos, the 27-year-old is clear where his future lies. Sky Sports Asked if he wanted to stay, Rashford told ESPN: “Oh yeah, for sure. “I’m enjoying this football club and I think for anybody who loves football, Barcelona is one of the key clubs in the history of the game. For a player it’s an honour.” Rashford has a contract at Old Trafford until 2028 but having also spent a brief spell on loan at Aston Villa last season it is highly unlikely he will return under current boss Ruben Amorim. “People forget this, but 24, 23 years of my life was with Manchester United, so sometimes you just need a change,” added Rashford. “I think maybe this is the case with me and I’m enjoying everything.”",2025-10-24

"Villa eyeing new deals for Rogers, Cash and McGinn","Aston Villa boss Unai Emery says the club are working on new contracts for Morgan Rogers, Matty Cash and John McGinn. All three have been a key part of Villa’s rise under Emery over the last couple of years, which culminated in them reaching the Champions League quarter-finals last season. Rogers, who is already under contract until 2030, has gone on to become an established member of Thomas Tuchel’s England side while Cash and McGinn attracted interest from Premier League clubs in the summer. And the club are trying to tie the trio down to long-term deals. “The club is working in the individual situation with Matty Cash, with Morgan and with John McGinn,” the Spaniard said ahead of Thursday’s Europa League match with Go Ahead Eagles. “And of course, they are very important players for us. Their commitment with Aston Villa is massive commitment, always being very, very positive, and playing with their qualities. “Now they are showing as well, probably getting better, and for the team that is very, very important.”",2025-10-22
Analysis: What does Tonali's new deal mean?,"Sky Sports' News' Keith Downie: This is the news the Newcastle fans had been hoping for some time, but they needn't have worried - the contract extension was already secretly in place. Tonali had agreed to a one-year extension, with the option of another (this is a club option, not player) last year. This agreement was made to protect Newcastle's position, but also because the midfielder wanted to show his appreciation for supporting him during his 10-month worldwide football ban for illegal gambling. The Italian international was banned at the time of the handshake. Sky Sports Still raw from the acrimonious departure of Alexander Isak to Liverpool on Deadline Day, the fear from Newcastle fans is that their best player, Tonali will be sold to one of Europe's top clubs next summer. So this should give them comfort. But this extension doesn't mean that Tonali won't leave next summer or the one after that. However it puts Newcastle in a much stronger position financially if the 25-year-old was to move on. And that's something Tonali wanted. If Newcastle take up their one-year option it ties him down at St James' Park until he's aged 30. It's a clever piece of business thrashed out at an awkward time. Can I see someone offering £100m for him within the next year? Yes. But do I see Tonali going on strike to force his exit from the club like Isak? No. For multiple reasons that scenario will not be repeated.",2025-10-22

Potter's pride as he returns to Sweden,"Graham Potter has spoken of his pride at returning to Sweden as national team manager, having begun his coaching career in the country. His first task is qualifying for the World Cup, having earned just just one point from their opening four qualifying games. “My feelings for being the Swedish national team manager are one of extreme pride, it’s a really exciting day for me,” Potter said. “It’s quite clear, we want to get to the World Cup, simple as that. We have to get the team together, playing well, winning games, and our aim is to get to the World Cup. “How I see the players, the team and the group is positive. The challenge now and the work is to make us into a really good team.” Potter took Ostersunds from the fourth division of Swedish football to the first division during his seven-year tenure at the club. “I think back to coming into the country in 2011, playing in the fourth tier in Swedish football, and so to be here now I'm incredibly proud and it feels really, really special,"" Potter added. “I always keep an eye on Swedish football because of my relationship with the country. “Swedish football means an incredible amount to me. It’s the start of my professional coaching career, I’ll be forever grateful for the time I had here, for the football family here – it’s an incredible place and one I'm really proud to be part of.” A poor run of results has left Sweden bottom of their qualifying group, and their most recent 1-0 defeat to Kosovo on October 13 led to the dismissal of Jon Dahl Tomasson. “I'm aware of the results that the team had and the players that we have, but now it’s about looking forward and I'm really excited to be here and help the team achieve the goal of the World Cup,” Potter said. “It’s an incredible opportunity for me, a very proud moment in my life and my career. “What I look forward to most is meeting the players, all the people in the football family in Sweden, our supporters, and then competing and winning games to get to the World Cup. “The message to our supporters is, we need their support.

We will find that out in the next few weeks. Because if he doesn't fancy him, he might have to move him on. ""But Mainoo's got that opportunity.
