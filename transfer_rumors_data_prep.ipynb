         "Sky Sports' News' Keith Downie: This is the news the Newcastle fans had been hoping for some time, but they needn't have worried - the contract extension was already secretly in place. Tonali had agreed to a one-year extension, with the option of another (this is a club option, not player) last year. This agreement was made to protect Newcastle's position, but also because the midfielder wanted to show his appreciation for supporting him during his 10-month worldwide football ban for illegal gambling. The Italian international was banned at the time of the handshake. Sky Sports Still raw from the acrimonious departure of Alexander Isak to Liverpool on Deadline Day, the fear from Newcastle fans is that their best player, Tonali will be sold to one of Europe's top clubs next summer. So this should give them comfort. But this extension doesn't mean that Tonali won't leave next summer or the one after that. However it puts Newcastle in a much stronger position financially if the 25-year-old was to move on. And that's something Tonali wanted. If Newcastle take up their one-year option it ties him down at St James' Park until he's aged 30. It's a clever piece of business thrashed out at an awkward time. Can I see someone offering £100m for him within the next year? Yes. But do I see Tonali going on strike to force his exit from the club like Isak? No. For multiple reasons that scenario will not be repeated.",

The France international, however, has not ruled out a move to the Premier League in the future. Asked about Spurs' interest, the 23-year-old said: \"It was very flattering to have these kind of stories and links, but I am a Monaco player and I am playing against Tottenham tomorrow, so I will give my best. \"In terms of whether I want to play in the Premier League in the future? Why not, but we’ll see. What is important for me is tomorrow’s game. Akliouche has scored twice this season and will be hoping to show Spurs why they were reportedly interested. Questioned on whether he will feel more pressure playing against Tottenham, he replied: \"I am focused on my performance and on the performance of the team. The important thing for us is to win the game. \"I am not focused at all on other links and pressure.\"",

Of course they were interested. “At one point. At that time I would have been interested. I was young, I had a sensational team at Dortmund, my God. They probably thought ‘what is he doing there?’ “They tried. It was the wrong time, wrong moment. I had a contract at Dortmund and wouldn’t have left, not really for nobody at that time. “There are some reasons [why he didn’t take the job]. The people in that conversation told me [things] which I didn’t like. “United was that big – “we get all the players we want. We get him, we get him, we get him, we get him” and I was sitting there … It was not my project. “It was the wrong time but on top of that it was not my project. I didn't want to bring back, I don’t know, Pogba. “Paul is a sensational player, my God, but these things don’t work usually. Or Cristiano, my God, we all know together with Messi he is the best player in the world but bringing back never helps. “At that time in 2013 it was obviously not about Cristiano maybe about Paul, I’m not even sure, [I don’t] get the numbers [dates] together, but the idea is we bring the best players together and let’s go.\"",

         "Graham Potter has spoken of his pride at returning to Sweden as national team manager, having begun his coaching career in the country. His first task is qualifying for the World Cup, having earned just just one point from their opening four qualifying games. “My feelings for being the Swedish national team manager are one of extreme pride, it’s a really exciting day for me,” Potter said. “It’s quite clear, we want to get to the World Cup, simple as that. We have to get the team together, playing well, winning games, and our aim is to get to the World Cup. “How I see the players, the team and the group is positive. The challenge now and the work is to make us into a really good team.” Potter took Ostersunds from the fourth division of Swedish football to the first division during his seven-year tenure at the club. “I think back to coming into the country in 2011, playing in the fourth tier in Swedish football, and so to be here now I'm incredibly proud and it feels really, really special,\" Potter added. “I always keep an eye on Swedish football because of my relationship with the country. “Swedish football means an incredible amount to me. It’s the start of my professional coaching career, I’ll be forever grateful for the time I had here, for the football family here – it’s an incredible place and one I'm really proud to be part of.” A poor run of results has left Sweden bottom of their qualifying group, and their most recent 1-0 defeat to Kosovo on October 13 led to the dismissal of Jon Dahl Tomasson. “I'm aware of the results that the team had and the players that we have, but now it’s about looking forward and I'm really excited to be here and help the team achieve the goal of the World Cup,” Potter said. “It’s an incredible opportunity for me, a very proud moment in my life and my career. “What I look forward to most is meeting the players, all the people in the football family in Sweden, our supporters, and then competing and winning games to get to the World Cup. “The message to our supporters is, we need their support. Swedish football fans are renowned for being incredible around the world and I'm really looking forward to experiencing that.”",

Sporting are thought to want £69m, including add-ons for the 27-year-old, as talks continue. Arsenal are understood to be encouraged and impressed with Gyokeres' desire to join, and in an interview with L'Equipe, the striker has reinforced his desire to play in the Premier League. \"It’s one of the biggest leagues in Europe,\" Gyokeres, who moved to Sporting having shone in the Championship, said. \"I spent several years there without being able to play a single match. So, of course, it’s something I would like to do. It would be a great revenge.\" Gyokeres stressed that any transfer has to be to a club that is desperate to have him. \"It’s football, you never know. I’m not thinking about it, we’ll see what happens.\" he said. \"If something is going to happen, it will happen. The most important thing for me is to play for a club that really wants me.\" Gyokeres made his debut in the Champions League last season and scored six goals in eight appearances, including a hat-trick in the 4-1 win at home to Manchester City last November. He believes he is among the world's top strikers such as Erling Haaland, Harry Kane and Robert Lewandowski. \"I’m definitely one of them,\" Gyokeres said. \"It’s difficult to rank me but yes, I’m at the same table as them now. \"What I managed to do at Sporting, I’m convinced I can do anywhere.
